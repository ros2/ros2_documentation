Intel ROS2 Projects
===================

Intel® Robotics Open Source Project (Intel® ROS Project) to enable the object detection, 2D location, 3D location and tracking with GPU or `Intel® Movidius™ NCS <https://developer.movidius.com/>`__ optimized deep learning backend, and `Intel® RealSense™ <http://www.intel.com/realsense>`__ camera under ROS2 framework.

Key Projects
------------

We will work on below ROS2 projects and publish source code at https://github.com/intel/ gradually.


* `ROS2 RealSense Camera <https://github.com/intel/ros2_intel_realsense>`__\ : ROS2 package for Intel® RealSense™ D400 serial cameras
* `ROS2 Movidius NCS <https://github.com/intel/ros2_intel_movidius_ncs>`__\ : ROS2 package for object detection with Intel® Movidius™ Neural Computing Stick (NCS).
* `ROS2 Object Messages <https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_msgs>`__\ : ROS2 messages for object.
* `ROS2 Object Analytics <https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_analytics>`__\ : ROS2 package for object detection, tracking and 2D/3D localization.
* `ROS2 Message Filters <https://github.com/intel/ros2_message_filters>`__\ : ROS2 package for message synchronization with time stamp.
* `ROS2 CV Bridge <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/tree/ros2/cv_bridge>`__\ : ROS2 package to bridge with openCV.
* `ROS2 Object Map <https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_map>`__\ : ROS2 package to mark tag of objects on map when SLAM based on information provided by ROS2 object analytics.
* `ROS2 Moving Object <https://github.com/intel/ros2_moving_object>`__\ : ROS2 package to provide object motion information (like object velocity on x, y, z axis) based on information provided by ROS2 object analytics.

Reference
