"tf2 is the transform library, which lets the user keep track of multiple "
"coordinate frames over time. tf2 maintains the relationship between "
"coordinate frames in a tree structure buffered in time and lets the user "
"transform points, vectors, etc. between any two coordinate frames at any "
"desired point in time."

"tf2 can operate in a distributed system. This means all the information "
"about the coordinate frames of a robot is available to all ROS 2 "
"components on any computer in the system. tf2 can have every component in"

"have a central node that gathers and stores all transform information."

"In addition to that, tf2 can broadcast static transforms that do not "
"change over time. This mainly saves storage and lookup time, but also "
"reduces the publishing overhead. You should note that static transforms "
"are published once and assumed to not change, so no history is stored. If"
" you want to define static transforms in your tf2 tree, take a look at "
