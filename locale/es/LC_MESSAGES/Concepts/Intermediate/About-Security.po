"ROS 2 includes the ability to secure communications among nodes within "
"the ROS 2 computational graph. Similar to discovery, security happens "
"through the underlying ROS 2 middleware (provided it has support for the "
"corresponding security plugins). No additional software installation is "
"needed to enable security; however, the middleware requires configuration"
" files for each ROS graph participant. These files enable encryption and "
"authentication, and define policies both for individual nodes and for the"
" overall ROS graph. ROS 2 also adds a master \"on/off\" switch to control"
" security behavior."

"Built-in ROS 2 security features enable control over communications "

"transit between ROS domain participants, but also enables authentication "
"of participants sending data, ensures the integrity of data being sent, "
"and enables domain-wide access controls."

"ROS 2 security services are provided by the underlying `Data Distribution"
" Service (DDS) <https://www.omg.org/spec/DDS/>`_ which is used for "
"communications between nodes. DDS vendors provide open source and "
"commercial DDS implementations that work with ROS. However, in order to "
"create a specification-compliant implementation of DDS, all vendors must "
"include security plugins as outlined in the `DDS Security Specification "
"<https://www.omg.org/spec/DDS-SECURITY/About-DDS-SECURITY/>`_. ROS "
"security features take advantage of these DDS security plugins to provide"
" policy-based encryption, authentication and access control. DDS and ROS "
"security is enabled through predefined configuration files and "
"environment variables."

"A security enclave encapsulates a single policy for protecting ROS "
"communications. The enclave may set policy for multiple nodes, for an "
"entire ROS graph, or any combination of protected ROS processes and "
"devices. Security enclaves can be flexibly mapped to processes, users, or"
" devices at deployment. Adjusting this default behavior becomes important"
" for optimizing communications and for complex systems. See the ROS 2 "
"Security Enclaves `design document "

"The Identity Certificate Authority file ``identity_ca.cert.pem`` acts as "
"the trust anchor used to identify participants. Each enclave also holds "
"its unique identifying certificate in the file ``cert.pem``, and the "
"associated private key in the file ``key.pem``. Because the ``cert.pem`` "
"certificate has been signed by identity certificate, when a participant "
"presents this certificate to other domain members, they are able to "
"validate the participant's identity using their own copy of the identity "
"certificate. This valid certificate exchange allows the enclave to "
"securely establish trusted communications with other participants. The "
"enclave does not not share the ``key.pem`` private key, but only uses it "
"for decryption and message signing."
