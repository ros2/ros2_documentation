"ROS 2 offers a rich variety of Quality of Service (QoS) policies that "
"allow you to tune communication between nodes. With the right set of "
"Quality of Service policies, ROS 2 can be as reliable as TCP or as best-"
"effort as UDP, with many, many possible states in between. Unlike ROS 1, "
"which primarily only supported TCP, ROS 2 benefits from the flexibility "
"of the underlying DDS transport in environments with lossy wireless "
"networks where a \"best effort\" policy would be more suitable, or in "
"real-time computing systems where the right Quality of Service profile is"
" needed to meet deadlines."

"A set of QoS \"policies\" combine to form a QoS \"profile\". Given the "
"complexity of choosing the correct QoS policies for a given scenario, ROS"
" 2 provides a set of predefined QoS profiles for common use cases (e.g. "
"sensor data). At the same time, developers are given the flexibility to "
"control specific policies of the QoS profiles."
