"The TSC aims to operate by consensus. When consensus cannot be reached, "
"decisions should in most cases be made by resource commitment: e.g., if a"
" member wants to include a feature on the roadmap but the rest of the TSC"
" is uninterested, then that member can choose to commit his or her "
"organization’s contribution to development of the desired feature and "
"thereby have it included in the roadmap. In cases where consensus cannot "
"be reached and resource commitment is insufficient or inappropriate, "
"simple majority voting is used, with each member having one vote."
