"With the introduction of DDS in ROS 2, Quality of Service (QoS) "
"compatibility for publisher/subscriber nodes needs to be considered when "
"recording and playing back data. More detail on how QoS works can be "
"found :doc:`here <../Concepts/Intermediate/About-Quality-of-Service-"
"Settings>`. For the purposes of this guide, it is sufficient to know that"
" only the reliability and durability policies affect whether "
"publishers/subscribers are compatible and can receive data from one "
"other."

"Ros2Bag adapts its requested/offered QoS profile when recording/playing "
"data from a topic to prevent dropped messages. During playback, Ros2bag "
"also attempts to preserve the policy originally offered by the topic. "
"Certain situations may require specifying explicit QoS profile settings "
"so Ros2Bag can record/playback topics. These QoS profile overrides can be"
" specified via the CLI using the ``--qos-profile-overrides-path`` flag."
