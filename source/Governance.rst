Project Governance
==================

Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
----------------------------------
Since the beginning of ROS, the project has been overseen and prioritized primarily by one organization, first Willow Garage and now Open Robotics.
That approach has worked well enough, as evidenced by the widespread adoption of ROS around the world.

But with ROS 2, we want to broaden participation to accelerate ROS 2 delivery, starting with these areas: determining the roadmap, developing core tools and libraries, and establishing working groups to focus on important topics.
To that end, we've established a Technical Steering Committee (TSC).
As described in the :download:`charter <Governance/ros2-tsc-charter.pdf>`, the TSC comprises representatives of organizations that are contributing to the development of ROS 2, and it has the responsibility to set the technical direction for the project.

The current members of the ROS 2 TSC are (15 as of 2019-08-23):
