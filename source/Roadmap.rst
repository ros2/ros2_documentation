This page describes planned work for ROS 2.
The set of planned features and development efforts should provide insight into the overall direction of ROS 2.
If you would like to see other features on the roadmap, please get in touch with us at info@openrobotics.org.

Humble Roadmap
----------------

Humble Hawksbill is the ROS 2 release expected in May 2022.
See :ref:`release <humble-release>` for a detailed timeline.

The items in the roadmap below are the major features being worked on by the ROS 2 community.
The "Size" is an estimated size of the task, where *Small* means person-days to complete, *Medium* means person-weeks to complete, and *Large* means person-months to complete.

If you are working on a feature for ROS 2 Humble and would like to have it listed, please open a pull request to `ROS 2 Documentation <https://github.com/ros2/ros2_documentation>`__.
If you'd like to take on one of these tasks, please :doc:`get in touch with us <Contact>`.
