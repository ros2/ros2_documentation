**Releasing a package in ROS 2 means to make your package available on the public ROS 2 buildfarm.**
After you've created a package, this is the next step towards getting your package into the publicly-available Debian packages so that others can install the package via ``apt``.

Follow one of the guides below:

* :doc:`First Time Release <First-Time-Release>` - if this is the first release for the package
* :doc:`Subsequent Releases <Subsequent-Releases>` - if you are releasing a new version of a package that has already been released

After successfully following the instructions, your package will be released into the ROS ecosystem on the next distro synchronization!
