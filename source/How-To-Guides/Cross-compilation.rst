Cross-compilation
=================

The `cross_compile <https://github.com/ros-tooling/cross_compile>`__ tool is not supported anymore.

An alternative to cross-compilation is to `build multi-platform Docker images <https://github.com/docker/buildx#building-multi-platform-images>`__ using ``docker buildx``.
