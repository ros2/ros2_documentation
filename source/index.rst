   Glossary

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications.
From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project.
And it's all open source.

Since ROS was started in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and ROS community.
The goal of the ROS 2 project is to adapt to these changes, leveraging what is great about ROS 1 and improving what isnâ€™t.

Here you will find the official documentation on **ROS 2**, the newest version of ROS.

If you're looking for documentation on ROS 1 (i.e., ROS as it has existed for several years, and what you might be using right now),
check the `ROS wiki <https://wiki.ros.org>`__.
