Debian packages for ROS 2 {DISTRO_TITLE_FULL} are currently available for Ubuntu Jammy.
The Rolling Ridley distribution will change target platforms from time to time as new platforms are selected for development.
The target platforms are defined in `REP 2000 <https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/blob/master/rep-2000.rst>`__
Most people will want to use a stable ROS distribution.

Install ROS 2 packages
----------------------

Update your apt repository caches after setting up the repositories.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt update

.. include:: _Apt-Upgrade-Admonition.rst

.. warning::

   Due to early updates in Ubuntu 22.04 it is important that ``systemd`` and ``udev``-related packages are updated before installing ROS 2.
   The installation of ROS 2's dependencies on a freshly installed system without upgrading can trigger the **removal of critical system packages**.

   Please refer to `ros2/ros2#1272 <https://github.com/ros2/ros2/issues/1272>`_ and `Launchpad #1974196 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1974196>`_ for more information.

Desktop Install (Recommended): ROS, RViz, demos, tutorials.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install ros-{DISTRO}-desktop

ROS-Base Install (Bare Bones): Communication libraries, message packages, command line tools.
No GUI tools.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install ros-{DISTRO}-ros-base

Development tools: Compilers and other tools to build ROS packages

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install ros-dev-tools

Environment setup
-----------------

Sourcing the setup script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set up your environment by sourcing the following file.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Replace ".bash" with your shell if you're not using bash
   # Possible values are: setup.bash, setup.sh, setup.zsh
   source /opt/ros/{DISTRO}/setup.bash

Try some examples
-----------------

Talker-listener
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you installed ``ros-{DISTRO}-desktop`` above you can try some examples.

In one terminal, source the setup file and then run a C++ ``talker``\ :

.. code-block:: bash

   source /opt/ros/{DISTRO}/setup.bash
   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

In another terminal source the setup file and then run a Python ``listener``\ :

.. code-block:: bash

   source /opt/ros/{DISTRO}/setup.bash
   ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener

You should see the ``talker`` saying that it's ``Publishing`` messages and the ``listener`` saying ``I heard`` those messages.
This verifies both the C++ and Python APIs are working properly.
Hooray!

Next steps after installing
---------------------------
Continue with the :doc:`tutorials and demos <../../Tutorials>` to configure your environment, create your own workspace and packages, and learn ROS 2 core concepts.

Using the ROS 1 bridge
----------------------
The ROS 1 bridge can connect topics from ROS 1 to ROS 2 and vice-versa. See the dedicated `documentation <https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge/blob/master/README.md>`__ on how to build and use the ROS 1 bridge.

Additional RMW implementations (optional)
-----------------------------------------
The default middleware that ROS 2 uses is ``Fast DDS``, but the middleware (RMW) can be replaced at runtime.
See the :doc:`guide <../How-To-Guides/Working-with-multiple-RMW-implementations>` on how to work with multiple RMWs.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Troubleshooting techniques can be found :doc:`here <../How-To-Guides/Installation-Troubleshooting>`.

Uninstall
---------

If you need to uninstall ROS 2 or switch to a source-based install once you
have already installed from binaries, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt remove ~nros-{DISTRO}-* && sudo apt autoremove

You may also want to remove the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt autoremove
  # Consider upgrading for packages previously shadowed.
  sudo apt upgrade
