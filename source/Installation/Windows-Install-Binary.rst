This page explains how to install ROS 2 on Windows from a pre-built binary package.

.. note::

    The pre-built binary does not include all ROS 2 packages.
    All packages in the `ROS base variant <https://ros.org/reps/rep-2001.html#ros-base>`_ are included, and only a subset of packages in the `ROS desktop variant <https://ros.org/reps/rep-2001.html#desktop-variants>`_ are included.
    The exact list of packages are described by the repositories listed in `this ros2.repos file <https://github.com/ros2/ros2/blob/{REPOS_FILE_BRANCH}/ros2.repos>`_.

System requirements
-------------------

Only Windows 10 is supported.

Downloading ROS 2
-----------------

Binary releases of {DISTRO_TITLE_FULL} are not provided.
Instead you may download nightly `prerelease binaries <Prerelease_binaries>`.

* Download the latest package for Windows, e.g., ``ros2-package-windows-AMD64.zip``.

.. note::

    There may be more than one binary download option which might cause the file name to differ.

.. note::

    To download the ROS 2 debug libraries you'll need to download ``ros2-package-windows-debug-AMD64.zip``

* Unpack the zip file somewhere (we'll assume ``C:\dev\ros2_{DISTRO}``\ ).

Environment setup
-----------------

Start a command shell and source the ROS 2 setup file to set up the workspace:

.. code-block:: bash

   call C:\dev\ros2_{DISTRO}\local_setup.bat

It is normal that the previous command, if nothing else went wrong, outputs "The system cannot find the path specified." exactly once.

Try some examples
-----------------

In a command shell, set up the ROS 2 environment as described above and then run a C++ ``talker``\ :

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

Start another command shell and run a Python ``listener``\ :

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener

You should see the ``talker`` saying that it's ``Publishing`` messages and the ``listener`` saying ``I heard`` those messages.
This verifies both the C++ and Python APIs are working properly.
Hooray!


Next steps after installing
---------------------------
Continue with the `tutorials and demos </Tutorials>` to configure your environment, create your own workspace and packages, and learn ROS 2 core concepts.

Using the ROS 1 bridge
----------------------
The ROS 1 bridge can connect topics from ROS 1 to ROS 2 and vice-versa. See the dedicated `documentation <https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge/blob/master/README.md>`__ on how to build and use the ROS 1 bridge.

Additional RMW implementations (optional)
-----------------------------------------
The default middleware that ROS 2 uses is ``Cyclone DDS``, but the middleware (RMW) can be replaced at runtime.
See the `guide <../How-To-Guides/Working-with-multiple-RMW-implementations>` on how to work with multiple RMWs.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Troubleshooting techniques can be found :ref:`here <windows-troubleshooting>`.

Uninstall
---------

1. If you installed your workspace with colcon as instructed above, "uninstalling" could be just a matter of opening a new terminal and not sourcing the workspace's ``setup`` file.
   This way, your environment will behave as though there is no {DISTRO_TITLE} install on your system.

2. If you're also trying to free up space, you can delete the entire workspace directory with:

   .. code-block:: bash

      rmdir /s /q \ros2_{DISTRO}
