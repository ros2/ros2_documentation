This guide is about how to setup a development environment for ROS 2 on Windows.

System requirements
-------------------

Only Windows 10 is supported.

Language support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure you have a locale which supports ``UTF-8``.
For example, for a Chinese-language Windows 10 installation, you may need to install an `English language pack <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/language-packs-for-windows-a5094319-a92d-18de-5b53-1cfc697cfca8>`_.

.. include:: ../_Windows-Install-Prerequisites.rst

Additional prerequisites
------------------------

When building from source you'll need a few additional prerequisites installed.

Install additional prerequisites from Chocolatey
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   choco install -y cppcheck curl git winflexbison3

You will need to append the Git cmd folder ``C:\Program Files\Git\cmd`` to the PATH (you can do this by clicking the Windows icon, typing "Environment Variables", then clicking on "Edit the system environment variables".
In the resulting dialog, click "Environment Variables", the click "Path" on the bottom pane, then click "Edit" and add the path).


Install Python prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installing additional Python dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -U colcon-common-extensions coverage flake8 flake8-blind-except flake8-builtins flake8-class-newline flake8-comprehensions flake8-deprecated flake8-docstrings flake8-import-order flake8-quotes mock mypy==0.931 pep8 pydocstyle pytest pytest-mock vcstool

Install miscellaneous prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next install xmllint:

* Download the `64 bit binary archives <https://www.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml/64bit/>`__ of ``libxml2`` (and its dependencies ``iconv`` and ``zlib``) from https://www.zlatkovic.com/projects/libxml/
* Unpack all archives into e.g. ``C:\xmllint``
* Add ``C:\xmllint\bin`` to the ``PATH``.

Get the ROS 2 code
------------------

Now that we have the development tools we can get the ROS 2 source code.

First setup a development folder, for example ``C:\{DISTRO}``:

.. note::

   It is very important that the chosen path is short, due to the short default Windows path limits (260 characters).
   To allow longer paths, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=registry.

.. code-block:: bash

   md \{DISTRO}\src
   cd \{DISTRO}

Get the ``ros2.repos`` file which defines the repositories to clone from:

.. code-block:: bash

   vcs import --input https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/{REPOS_FILE_BRANCH}/ros2.repos src

Install additional DDS implementations (optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fast DDS is bundled with the ROS 2 source and will always be built unless you put an ``COLCON_IGNORE`` file in the ``src\eProsima`` folder.

If you would like to use another DDS or RTPS vendor besides the default, you can find instructions :doc:`here <../DDS-Implementations>`.

Build the ROS 2 code
--------------------

.. _windows-dev-build-ros2:

To build ROS 2 you will need a Visual Studio Command Prompt ("x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019") running as Administrator.

To build the ``\{DISTRO}`` folder tree:

.. code-block:: bash

   colcon build --merge-install

.. note::

   We're using ``--merge-install`` here to avoid a ``PATH`` variable that is too long at the end of the build.
   If you're adapting these instructions to build a smaller workspace then you might be able to use the default behavior which is isolated install, i.e. where each package is installed to a different folder.

.. note::

   If you are doing a debug build use ``python_d path\to\colcon_executable`` ``colcon``.
   See `Extra stuff for debug mode`_ for more info on running Python code in debug builds on Windows.

Environment setup
-----------------

Start a command shell and source the ROS 2 setup file to set up the workspace:

.. code-block:: bash

   call C:\{DISTRO}\install\local_setup.bat

This will automatically set up the environment for any DDS vendors that support was built for.

It is normal that the previous command, if nothing else went wrong, outputs "The system cannot find the path specified." exactly once.

Test and run
------------

Note that the first time you run any executable you will have to allow access to the network through a Windows Firewall popup.

You can run the tests using this command:

.. code-block:: bash

   colcon test --merge-install

.. note::

   ``--merge-install`` should only be used if it was also used in the build step.

Afterwards you can get a summary of the tests using this command:

.. code-block:: bash

   colcon test-result

To run the examples, first open a clean new ``cmd.exe`` and set up the workspace by sourcing the ``local_setup.bat`` file.
Then, run a C++ ``talker``\ :

.. code-block:: bash

   call install\local_setup.bat
   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

In a separate shell you can do the same, but instead run a Python ``listener``\ :

.. code-block:: bash

   call install\local_setup.bat
   ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener

You should see the ``talker`` saying that it's ``Publishing`` messages and the ``listener`` saying ``I heard`` those messages.
This verifies both the C++ and Python APIs are working properly.
Hooray!


.. note::

   It is not recommended to build in the same cmd prompt that you've sourced the ``local_setup.bat``.

Next steps after installing
---------------------------
Continue with the :doc:`tutorials and demos <../../Tutorials>` to configure your environment, create your own workspace and packages, and learn ROS 2 core concepts.

Additional RMW implementations (optional)
-----------------------------------------
The default middleware that ROS 2 uses is ``Fast DDS``, but the middleware (RMW) can be replaced at runtime.
See the :doc:`guide <../../How-To-Guides/Working-with-multiple-RMW-implementations>` on how to work with multiple RMWs.


Extra stuff for Debug mode
--------------------------

If you want to be able to run all the tests in Debug mode, you'll need to install a few more things:


* To be able to extract the Python source tarball, you can use PeaZip:

.. code-block:: bash

   choco install -y peazip


* You'll also need SVN, since some of the Python source-build dependencies are checked out via SVN:

.. code-block:: bash

   choco install -y svn hg


* You'll need to quit and restart the command prompt after installing the above.
* Get and extract the Python 3.8.3 source from the ``tgz``:

  * https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.3/Python-3.8.3.tgz
  * To keep these instructions concise, please extract it to ``C:\dev\Python-3.8.3``

* Now, build the Python source in debug mode from a Visual Studio command prompt:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd C:\dev\Python-3.8.3\PCbuild
   get_externals.bat
   build.bat -p x64 -d


* Finally, copy the build products into the Python38 installation directories, next to the Release-mode Python executable and DLL's:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd C:\dev\Python-3.8.3\PCbuild\amd64
   copy python_d.exe C:\Python38 /Y
   copy python38_d.dll C:\Python38 /Y
   copy python3_d.dll C:\Python38 /Y
   copy python38_d.lib C:\Python38\libs /Y
   copy python3_d.lib C:\Python38\libs /Y
   copy sqlite3_d.dll C:\Python38\DLLs /Y
   for %I in (*_d.pyd) do copy %I C:\Python38\DLLs /Y


* Now, from a fresh command prompt, make sure that ``python_d`` works:

.. code-block:: bash

   python_d -c "import _ctypes ; import coverage"

* Once you have verified the operation of ``python_d``, it is necessary to reinstall a few dependencies with the debug-enabled libraries:

.. code-block:: bash

   python_d -m pip install --force-reinstall https://github.com/ros2/ros2/releases/download/numpy-archives/numpy-1.18.4-cp38-cp38d-win_amd64.whl
   python_d -m pip install --force-reinstall https://github.com/ros2/ros2/releases/download/lxml-archives/lxml-4.5.1-cp38-cp38d-win_amd64.whl

* To verify the installation of these dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   python_d -c "from lxml import etree ; import numpy"

* When you wish to return to building release binaries, it is necessary to uninstall the debug variants and use the release variants:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip uninstall numpy lxml
   python -m pip install numpy lxml

* To create executables python scripts(.exe), python_d should be used to invoke colcon

.. code-block:: bash

   python_d path\to\colcon_executable build

* Hooray, you're done!

Stay up to date
---------------

See :doc:`../Maintaining-a-Source-Checkout` to periodically refresh your source installation.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Troubleshooting techniques can be found :ref:`here <windows-troubleshooting>`.

Uninstall
---------

1. If you installed your workspace with colcon as instructed above, "uninstalling" could be just a matter of opening a new terminal and not sourcing the workspace's ``setup`` file.
   This way, your environment will behave as though there is no {DISTRO_TITLE} install on your system.

2. If you're also trying to free up space, you can delete the entire workspace directory with:

   .. code-block:: bash

      rmdir /s /q \ros2_{DISTRO}
