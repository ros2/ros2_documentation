This page explains how to install ROS 2 on Linux from a pre-built binary package.

.. note::

    The pre-built binary does not include all ROS 2 packages.
    All packages in the `ROS base variant <https://ros.org/reps/rep-2001.html#ros-base>`_ are included, and only a subset of packages in the `ROS desktop variant <https://ros.org/reps/rep-2001.html#desktop-variants>`_ are included.
    The exact list of packages are described by the repositories listed in `this ros2.repos file <https://github.com/ros2/ros2/blob/eloquent-release/ros2.repos>`_.

There are also `Debian packages <Linux-Install-Debians>` available.

System Requirements
-------------------

We support Ubuntu Linux Bionic Beaver (18.04) and Ubuntu Xenial Xerus (16.04) on 64-bit x86 and 64-bit ARM.

Note: Ardent and beta versions supported Ubuntu Xenial Xerus 16.04.

Add the ROS 2 apt repository
----------------------------

.. include:: _Apt-Repositories.rst

Downloading ROS 2
-----------------


* Go `the releases page <https://github.com/ros2/ros2/releases>`_
* Download the latest package for Linux; let's assume that it ends up at ``~/Downloads/ros2-eloquent-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2``.

  * Note: there may be more than one binary download option which might cause the file name to differ.

*
  Unpack it:

  .. code-block:: bash

       mkdir -p ~/ros2_eloquent
       cd ~/ros2_eloquent
       tar xf ~/Downloads/ros2-eloquent-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2

Installing and initializing rosdep
----------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install -y python-rosdep
       sudo rosdep init
       rosdep update --rosdistro=eloquent

.. _linux-install-binary-install-missing-dependencies:

Installing the missing dependencies
-----------------------------------

Set your rosdistro according to the release you downloaded.

.. code-block:: bash

       rosdep install --from-paths ros2-linux/share --ignore-src --rosdistro eloquent -y --skip-keys "console_bridge fastcdr fastrtps libopensplice67 libopensplice69 osrf_testing_tools_cpp poco_vendor rmw_connext_cpp rosidl_typesupport_connext_c rosidl_typesupport_connext_cpp rti-connext-dds-5.3.1 tinyxml_vendor tinyxml2_vendor urdfdom urdfdom_headers"

#. *Optional*\ : if you want to use the ROS 1<->2 bridge, then you must also install ROS 1.
   Follow the normal install instructions: https://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu

Installing the python3 libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install -y libpython3-dev python3-pip
   pip3 install -U argcomplete

Install additional DDS implementations (optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you would like to use another DDS or RTPS vendor besides the default, eProsima's Fast RTPS, you can find instructions `here <DDS-Implementations>`.

Environment setup
-----------------

Sourcing the setup script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set up your environment by sourcing the following file.

.. code-block:: bash

  . ~/ros2_eloquent/ros2-linux/setup.bash

Try some examples
-----------------

In one terminal, source the setup file and then run a C++ ``talker``:

.. code-block:: bash

   . ~/ros2_eloquent/ros2-linux/setup.bash
   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

In another terminal source the setup file and then run a Python ``listener``:

.. code-block:: bash

   . ~/ros2_eloquent/ros2-linux/setup.bash
   ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener

You should see the ``talker`` saying that it's ``Publishing`` messages and the ``listener`` saying ``I heard`` those messages.
This verifies both the C++ and Python APIs are working properly.
Hooray!


Next steps after installing
---------------------------
Continue with the `tutorials and demos </Tutorials>` to configure your environment, create your own workspace and packages, and learn ROS 2 core concepts.

Using the ROS 1 bridge
----------------------
The ROS 1 bridge can connect topics from ROS 1 to ROS 2 and vice-versa. See the dedicated `documentation <https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge/blob/master/README.md>`__ on how to build and use the ROS 1 bridge.

Additional RMW implementations (optional)
-----------------------------------------
The default middleware that ROS 2 uses is ``Fast-RTPS``, but the middleware (RMW) can be replaced at runtime.
See the `tutorial </Tutorials/Working-with-multiple-RMW-implementations>` on how to work with multiple RMWs.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Troubleshooting techniques can be found `here </Troubleshooting>`.

Uninstall
---------

1. If you installed your workspace with colcon as instructed above, "uninstalling" could be just a matter of opening a new terminal and not sourcing the workspace's ``setup`` file.
   This way, your environment will behave as though there is no Eloquent install on your system.

2. If you're also trying to free up space, you can delete the entire workspace directory with:

   .. code-block:: bash

    rm -rf ~/ros2_eloquent
