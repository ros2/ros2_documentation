System setup
------------

Install Chocolatey
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows, install it by following their installation instructions:

https://chocolatey.org/install

You'll use Chocolatey to install some other developer tools.

Install Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a Command Prompt and type the following to install Python via Chocolatey:

.. code-block:: bash

   choco install -y python --version 3.8.3

.. note::

   Chocolatey will install Python in ``C:\Python38``, and the rest of the installation expects it to be there.
   If you've installed Python somewhere else, you must copy or link it to that location.

Install Visual C++ Redistributables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a Command Prompt and type the following to install them via Chocolatey:

.. code-block:: bash

   choco install -y vcredist2013 vcredist140

Install OpenSSL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the *Win64 OpenSSL v1.1.1n* OpenSSL installer from `this page <https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html>`__.
Scroll to the bottom of the page and download *Win64 OpenSSL v1.1.1t*.
Don't download the Win32 or Light versions, or the v3.X.Y installers.

Run the installer with default parameters, as the following commands assume you used the default installation directory.

This command sets an environment variable that persists over sessions:

.. code-block:: bash

   setx /m OPENSSL_CONF "C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.cfg"

You will need to append the OpenSSL-Win64 bin folder to your PATH.
You can do this by clicking the Windows icon, typing "Environment Variables", then clicking on "Edit the system environment variables".
In the resulting dialog, click "Environment Variables", then click "Path" on the bottom pane, finally click "Edit" and add the path below.

* ``C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\``

Install Visual Studio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install Visual Studio 2019.

If you already have a paid version of Visual Studio 2019 (Professional, Enterprise), skip this step.

Microsoft provides a free of charge version of Visual Studio 2019, named Community, which can be used to build applications that use ROS 2.
`You can download the installer directly through this link. <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16&src=myvs&utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=my.visualstudio.com&utm_campaign=download&utm_content=vs+community+2019>`_

Make sure that the Visual C++ features are installed.

An easy way to make sure they're installed is to select the ``Desktop development with C++`` workflow during the install.

   .. image:: /Installation/images/windows-vs-studio-install.png

Make sure that no C++ CMake tools are installed by unselecting them in the list of components to be installed.

Install OpenCV
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of the examples require OpenCV to be installed.

You can download a precompiled version of OpenCV 3.4.6 from https://github.com/ros2/ros2/releases/download/opencv-archives/opencv-3.4.6-vc16.VS2019.zip .

Assuming you unpacked it to ``C:\opencv``, type the following on a Command Prompt (requires Admin privileges):

.. code-block:: bash

   setx /m OpenCV_DIR C:\opencv

Since you are using a precompiled ROS version, we have to tell it where to find the OpenCV libraries.
You have to extend the ``PATH`` variable to ``C:\opencv\x64\vc16\bin``.

Install dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a few dependencies not available in the Chocolatey package database.
In order to ease the manual installation process, we provide the necessary Chocolatey packages.

As some chocolatey packages rely on it, we start by installing CMake

.. code-block:: bash

   choco install -y cmake

You will need to append the CMake bin folder ``C:\Program Files\CMake\bin`` to your PATH.

Please download these packages from `this <https://github.com/ros2/choco-packages/releases/latest>`__ GitHub repository.

* asio.1.12.1.nupkg
* bullet.3.17.nupkg
* cunit.2.1.3.nupkg
* eigen-3.3.4.nupkg
* tinyxml2.6.0.0.nupkg

Once these packages are downloaded, open an administrative shell and execute the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   choco install -y -s <PATH\TO\DOWNLOADS\> asio cunit eigen tinyxml2 bullet

Please replace ``<PATH\TO\DOWNLOADS>`` with the folder you downloaded the packages to.

First upgrade pip and setuptools:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install -U pip setuptools==59.6.0

Now install some additional python dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install -U catkin_pkg cryptography empy importlib-metadata jsonschema lark==1.1.1 lxml matplotlib netifaces numpy opencv-python PyQt5 pillow psutil pycairo pydot pyparsing==2.4.7 pyyaml rosdistro

Install miscellaneous prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next install xmllint:

* Download the `64 bit binary archives <https://www.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml/64bit/>`__ of ``libxml2`` (and its dependencies ``iconv`` and ``zlib``) from https://www.zlatkovic.com/projects/libxml/
* Unpack all archives into e.g. ``C:\xmllint``
* Add ``C:\xmllint\bin`` to the ``PATH``.

Install Qt5
^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the `5.12.X offline installer <https://www.qt.io/offline-installers>`_ from Qt's website.
Run the installer.
Make sure to select the ``MSVC 2017 64-bit`` component under the ``Qt`` -> ``Qt 5.12.12`` tree.

Finally, in an administrator ``cmd.exe`` window set these environment variables.
The commands below assume you installed it to the default location of ``C:\Qt``.

.. code-block:: bash

   setx /m Qt5_DIR C:\Qt\Qt5.12.12\5.12.12\msvc2017_64
   setx /m QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH C:\Qt\Qt5.12.12\5.12.12\msvc2017_64\plugins\platforms


.. note::

   This path might change based on the installed MSVC version, the directory Qt was installed to, and the version of Qt installed.

RQt dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run rqt_graph you need to `download <https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html>`__ and install `Graphviz <https://graphviz.gitlab.io/>`__.
The installer will ask if to add graphviz to PATH, choose to either add it to the current user or all users.
