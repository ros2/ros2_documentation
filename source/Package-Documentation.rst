ROS Package Documentation
=========================

ROS package documentation, that is to say documenation for specific packages you install via apt or some other tool, can be found in multiple places. Here is a brief list of where to look for specific ROS package documenation.

Package Documentation on docs.ros.org
-------------------------------------

* Most ROS 2 packages have their package level documentation `included in this index page <https://docs.ros.org/en/{DISTRO_TITLE}/p/>`__.
* This documentation is also available on `ROS Index <https://index.ros.org/packages/#{DISTRO_TITLE}>`__
* For some packages the

Larger "Meta" Packages
----------------------

Larger "meta" packages, like MoveIt, Nav2, etc, are given their own subdomain on docs.ros.org. Here is a short list.

* `MoveIt (arms, inverse kinematics, etec) <https://moveit.ros.org/>`__
* `Navigation (aka NavStack) <https://navigation.ros.org/>`__
* `Control (control systems) <https://control.ros.org/master/index.html>`__
* `microROS (embedded systems) <https://micro.ros.org/>`__
* `MoveIt <>`__

Adding Your Package to docs.ros.org
-----------------------------------

* All ROS 2 indexed ROS 2 packages are automatically added to docs.ros.org.
  If you would like to enable or configure your own package please see :doc:`this guide <How-To-Guides/Documenting-a-ROS-2-Package>`.
