About ROS 2 middleware implementations
======================================

.. include:: ../../global_substitutions.txt

ROS middleware implementations are sets of |packages| that implement some of the internal ROS interfaces, e.g. the ``rmw``, ``rcl``, and ``rosidl`` |APIs|.

Common Packages for DDS Middleware Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of the current ROS middleware implementations are based on full or partial DDS implementations.
For example, there is a middleware implementation that uses RTI's Connext DDS and an implementation which uses eProsima's Fast DDS.
Because of this, there are some shared |packages| amongst most DDS based middleware implementations.

In the `ros2/rosidl_dds <https://github.com/ros2/rosidl_dds>`_ repository on |GitHub|_, there is the following |package|:

-  ``rosidl_generator_dds_idl``: provides tools to generate DDS ``.idl`` files from ``rosidl`` files, e.g. ``.msg`` files, ``.srv`` files, etc.

The ``rosidl_generator_dds_idl`` |package| generates a DDS ``.idl`` file for each ``rosidl`` file, e.g. ``.msg`` file, defined by |packages| containing messages.
Currently DDS based ROS middleware implementations make use of this generator's output ``.idl`` files to generate pre-compiled type support that is vendor specific.

Structure of ROS Middleware Implementations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ROS middleware implementation is typically made up of a few |packages| in a single repository:

-  ``<implementation_name>_cmake_module``: contains CMake Module for discovering and exposing required dependencies
-  ``rmw_<implementation_name>_<language>``: contains the implementation of the ``rmw`` |API| in a particular language, typically C++
-  ``rosidl_typesupport_<implementation_name>_<language>``: contains tools to generate static type support code for ``rosidl`` files, tailored to the implementation in a particular language, typically C or C++

The ``<implementation_name>_cmake_module`` |package| contains any CMake Modules and functions needed to find the supporting dependencies for the middleware implementation.
For example, ``rti_connext_dds_cmake_module`` provides wrapper logic around the CMake Module shipped with RTI Connext DDS to make sure that all packages that depend on it will select the same installation of RTI Connext DDS.
Similarly, ``fastrtps_cmake_module`` includes a CMake Module to find eProsima's Fast DDS.
Not all implementations will have a package like this: for example, Eclipe's Cyclone DDS already provides a CMake Module which is used directly by its RMW implementation without the need of additional wrappers.

The ``rmw_<implementation_name>_<language>`` |package| implements the ``rmw`` C |API| in a particular language.
The implementation itself can be C++, it just must expose the header's symbols as ``extern "C"`` so that C applications can link against it.

The ``rosidl_typesupport_<implementation_name>_<language>`` |package| provides a generator which generates DDS code in a particular language.
This is done using the ``.idl`` files generated by the ``rosidl_generator_dds_idl`` |package| and the DDS IDL code generator provided by the DDS vendor.
It also generates code for converting ROS message structures to and from DDS message structures.
This generator is also responsible for creating a shared library for the message package it is being used in, which is specific to the messages in the message package and to the DDS vendor being used.

As mentioned above, the ``rosidl_typesupport_introspection_<language>`` may be used instead of a vendor specific type support package if an rmw implementation supports runtime interpretation of messages.
This ability to programmatically send and receive types over topics without generating code beforehand is achieved by supporting the `DDS X-Types Dynamic Data standard <http://www.omg.org/spec/DDS-XTypes>`_.
As such, rmw implementations may provide support for the X-Types standard, and/or provide a package for type support generated at compile time specific to their DDS implementation.

As an example of an rmw implementation repository, the ``Eclipse Cyclone DDS`` ROS middleware implementation is on |GitHub|_ at `ros2/rmw_cyclonedds <https://github.com/ros2/rmw_cyclonedds>`_.

The rmw implementation for ``Fast DDS`` is on |GitHub|_ at `ros2/rmw_fastrtps_cpp <https://github.com/ros2/rmw_fastrtps_cpp>`_.

The rmw implementation for ``Connext DDS`` is on |GitHub|_ at `ros2/rmw_connextdds <https://github.com/ros2/rmw_connextdds>`_.
