Basic Concepts
==============

ROS 2 is a middleware based on a strongly-typed, anonymous publish/subscribe mechanism that allows for message passing between different processes.

At the heart of any ROS 2 system is the ROS graph.
The ROS graph refers to the network of nodes in a ROS system and the connections between them by which they communicate.

These are the concepts that will help you get started understanding the basics of ROS 2.
