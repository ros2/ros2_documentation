ROS 2 Client Interfaces (Client Libraries)
==========================================

.. include:: ../../global_substitutions.txt

ROS Client Interfaces, a.k.a. |client libraries|, are user facing interfaces which provide the high level functionality and are built on top of the ``rcl`` and ``rosidl`` |APIs|.

    The ``rclc`` Package
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The ROS Client Library for C (``rclc``) is the user facing C idiomatic interface which provides all of the ROS client functionality like creating nodes, publisher, and subscribers.
    This |API| uses the ``rcl`` |API| and the ``rosidl`` |API| to implement its functions.
    Because both ``rcl`` and ``rclc`` are written in C, you might wonder what the difference is between the two |APIs|.
    The ``rcl`` |API| provides functions for things like creating nodes, publishers, and subscribers, which are exposed through to the ``rclc`` |API|, but the ``rclc`` |API| additionally handles things like the threading model, configuration, and other components of the client library which are solved differently in different languages.
    Since ``rcl`` and ``rclc`` are so similar to each other, ``rclc`` essential can be described as ``rcl`` plus execution (threading).
    However, the distinction becomes clearer when you consider client libraries in different languages.

    The ``rclc`` repository is located on |GitHub|_ at `ros2/rclc <https://github.com/ros2/rclc>`_ and contains the |package| ``rclc`` which contains the development resources, interface and reference implementation that is required at runtime.

The ``rclcpp`` Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ROS Client Library for C++ (``rclcpp``) is the user facing, C++ idiomatic interface which provides all of the ROS client functionality like creating nodes, publisher, and subscribers.
``rclcpp`` builds on top of ``rcl`` and the ``rosidl`` |API|, and it is designed to be used with the C++ messages generated by ``rosidl_generator_cpp``.

``rclcpp`` makes use of all the features of C++ and C++11 to make the interface as easy to use as possible, but since it reuses the implementation in ``rcl`` it is able maintain a consistent behavior with the other client libraries that use the ``rcl`` |API|.

The ``rclcpp`` repository is located on |GitHub|_ at `ros2/rclcpp <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp>`_ and contains the |package| ``rclcpp``.
The generated |API| documentation is here:

The ``rclpy`` Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ROS Client Library for Python (``rclpy``) is the Python counterpart to the C++ client library.
Like the C++ client library, ``rclpy`` also builds on top of the ``rcl`` C API for its implementation.
The interface provides an idiomatic Python experience which uses native Python types and patterns like lists and context objects, but by using the ``rcl`` |API| in the implementation it stays consistent with the other client libraries in terms of feature parity and behavior.
In addition to providing Python idiomatic bindings around the ``rcl`` |API| and Python classes for each message, the Python client library takes care of the execution model, using ``threading.Thread`` or similar to run the functions in the ``rcl`` |API|.

Like C++ it generates custom Python code for each ROS message that the user interacts with, but unlike C++ it eventually converts the native Python message object into the C version of the message.
All operations happen on the Python version of the messages until they need to be passed into the ``rcl`` layer, at which point they are converted into the plain C version of the message so it can be passed into the ``rcl`` C |API|.
This is avoided if possible when communicating between publishers and subscribers in the same process to cut down on the conversion into and out of Python.

The ``rclpy`` repository is located on |GitHub|_ at `ros2/rclpy <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy>`_ and contains the |package| ``rclpy``.
