Guides
======

Guides provide direct and modular answers to "How-to" questions regarding key aspects of ROS 2.
They contain succinct steps to help you accomplish important tasks quickly.

Guides are meant for users who already have some knowledge of ROS 2 and just want to find out how to implement something specific.
They will not go in-depth by providing background information or teaching how a concept ties into the greater ROS 2 ecosystem.

If you are new and looking to learn the ropes, start with the :ref:`Tutorials <Tutorials>` for a more well-rounded progression through ROS 2.
