Distributions
=============

What is a Distribution?
-----------------------

A ROS distribution is a versioned set of ROS packages.
These are akin to Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu).
The purpose of the ROS distributions is to let developers work against a relatively stable codebase until they are ready to roll everything forward.
Therefore once a distribution is released, we try to limit changes to bug fixes and non-breaking improvements for the core packages (every thing under ros-desktop-full).
That generally applies to the whole community, but for "higher" level packages, the rules are less strict, and so it falls to the maintainers of a given package to avoid breaking changes.

List of Distributions

Below is a list of current and historic ROS 2 distributions.
Rows in the table marked in green are the currently supported distributions.

   <!--
     This CSS overrides the styles of certain rows to mark them green, indicating they are supported releases.
     For the odd number rows, a line like the following must be used:

       .rst-content table.docutils:not(.field-list) tr:nth-child(1) td {background-color: #33cc66;}

     For the even number rows, a line like the following must be used:

       .rst-content tr:nth-child(2) {background-color: #33cc66;}

     No other combination I've found has worked.  Yes, this is extremely fragile.  No, I don't understand
     why it is like this.

Future Distributions
--------------------

For details on upcoming features see the :doc:`roadmap <The-ROS2-Project/Roadmap>`.

There is a new ROS 2 distribution released yearly on May 23rd (`World Turtle Day <https://www.worldturtleday.org/>`_).

The expectation is to release new ROS 2 distributions once per year.

.. _rolling_distribution:

Rolling Distribution
--------------------

:doc:`ROS 2 Rolling Ridley <Releases/Release-Rolling-Ridley>` is the rolling development distribution of ROS 2.
It is described in `REP 2002 <https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2002.html>`_ and was first introduced in June 2020.

The Rolling distribution of ROS 2 serves two purposes:

1. it is a staging area for future stable distributions of ROS 2, and
2. it is a collection of the most recent development releases.

As the name implies, Rolling is continuously updated and **can have in-place updates that include breaking changes**.
We recommend that most people use the most recent stable distribution instead (see :ref:`list_of_distributions`).

Packages released into the Rolling distribution will be automatically released into future stable distributions of ROS 2.
:doc:`Releasing a ROS 2 package <../How-To-Guides/Releasing/Releasing-a-Package>` into the Rolling distribution follows the same procedures as all other ROS 2 distributions.
