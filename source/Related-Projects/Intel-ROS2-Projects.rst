Intel ROS 2 Projects
====================

Intel® Robotics Open Source Project (Intel® ROS Project) to enable object detection/location/tracking, people detection, vehicle detection, industry robot arm grasp point analysis with kinds of Intel technologies and platforms, including CPU, GPU, `Intel® Movidius™ NCS <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/neural-compute-stick/overview.html>`__ optimized deep learning backend, FPGA, `Intel® RealSense™ <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html>`__ camera, etc.

Key Projects
------------

We are working on below ROS 2 projects and publish source code through https://github.com/intel/ or ROS 2 GitHub repo gradually.

* `ROS2 OpenVINO <https://github.com/intel/ros2_openvino_toolkit>`__: ROS 2 package for Intel® Visual Inference and Neural Network Optimization Toolkit to develop multiplatform computer vision solutions.
* `ROS2 RealSense Camera <https://github.com/intel/ros2_intel_realsense>`__: ROS 2 package for Intel® RealSense™ D400 serial cameras
* `ROS2 Movidius NCS <https://github.com/intel/ros2_intel_movidius_ncs>`__: ROS 2 package for object detection with Intel® Movidius™ Neural Computing Stick (NCS).
* `ROS2 Object Messages <https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_msgs>`__: ROS 2 messages for object.
* `ROS2 Object Analytics <https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_analytics>`__: ROS 2 package for object detection, tracking and 2D/3D localization.
* `ROS2 Message Filters <https://github.com/ros2/message_filters>`__: ROS 2 package for message synchronization with time stamp.
* `ROS2 CV Bridge <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/tree/ros2/cv_bridge>`__: ROS 2 package to bridge with openCV.
* `ROS2 Object Map <https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_map>`__: ROS 2 package to mark tag of objects on map when SLAM based on information provided by ROS 2 object analytics.
* `ROS2 Moving Object <https://github.com/intel/ros2_moving_object>`__: ROS 2 package to provide object motion information (like object velocity on x, y, z axis) based on information provided by ROS 2 object analytics.
* `ROS2 Grasp Library <https://github.com/intel/ros2_grasp_library>`__: ROS 2 package for grasp position analysis, and compatible with `MoveIt <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2.git>`__ grasp interfaces.
* `ROS2 Navigation <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2>`__: ROS 2 package for robot navigation, it's already integrated to ROS 2 Crystal release.
* `Intel Robot DevKit (SDK) <https://github.com/intel/robot_devkit>`__: An open source project which enables developers to easily and efficiently create, customize, optimize, and deploy a robot software stack to an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) platform based on the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework.
