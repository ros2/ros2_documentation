New features in this ROS 2 release
----------------------------------


Changes in Patch Release 1 (2022-11-23)
---------------------------------------

ros2topic
^^^^^^^^^

``now`` as keyword for ``builtin_interfaces.msg.Time`` and ``auto`` for ``std_msgs.msg.Header``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
``ros2 topic pub`` now allows to set a ``builtin_interfaces.msg.Time`` message to the current time via the ``now`` keyword.
Similarly, a ``std_msg.msg.Header`` message will be automatically generated when passed the keyword ``auto``.
This behavior matches that of ROS 1's ``rostopic`` (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/YAMLCommandLine#Headers.2Ftimestamps)

Related PR: `ros2/ros2cli#751 <https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/pull/751>`_

Changes since the Galactic release
----------------------------------

ament_cmake_gen_version_h
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Generating a C/C++ header with version info
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
A new CMake function to generate a header with the package version info was added to the ``ament_cmake_gen_version_h`` in `ament/ament_cmake#377 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/pull/377>`__.
Here's the simplest use case:

.. code-block:: CMake

    project(my_project)
    add_library(my_lib ...)
    ament_generate_version_header(my_lib)

It will generate a header with version info from the ``package.xml`` and make it available to targets that link against the ``my_lib`` library.

How to include the header:

.. code-block:: C

    #include <my_project/version.h>

Where the header is installed to:

.. code-block:: cmake

    set(VERSION_HEADER ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/my_project/my_project/version.h)

launch
^^^^^^

Scoping environment variables in group actions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Similar to launch configurations, now by default, the state of environment variables are scoped to group actions.

For example, in the following launch files the executed processe will echo the value ``1`` (before Humble it would echo ``2``):

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: XML

    .. code-block:: xml

      <launch>
        <set_env name="FOO" value="1" />
        <group>
          <set_env name="FOO" value="2" />
        </group>
        <executable cmd="echo $FOO" output="screen" shell="true" />
      </launch>

   .. group-tab:: Python

      .. code-block:: python

        import launch
        import launch.actions

        def generate_launch_description():
            return launch.LaunchDescription([
                launch.actions.SetEnvironmentVariable(name='FOO', value='1'),
                launch.actions.GroupAction([
                    launch.actions.SetEnvironmentVariable(name='FOO', value='2'),
                ]),
                launch.actions.ExecuteProcess(cmd=['echo', '$FOO'], output='screen', shell=True),
            ])

If you would like disable scoping for launch configurations and and environment variables you can set the ``scoped`` argument (or attribute) to false.

launch_pytest
"""""""""""""

We've added a new package, ``launch_pytest``, that acts as an alternative to ``launch_testing``.
``launch_pytest`` is a simple pytest plugin that provides pytest fixtures to manage the lifetime of a launch service.

Check out the `package README for details and examples. <https://github.com/ros2/launch/tree/humble/launch_pytest>`_

Related PR: `ros2/launch#528 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/pull/528>`_

Allow matching target actions with a callable
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Event handlers that take a target action object to match can now also take a callable instead to do the matching.

Related PR: `ros2/launch#540 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/pull/540>`_

Access to math module when evaluating Python expressions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Inside ``PythonExpression`` substitutions (``eval``) we can now use symbols from Python's math module.
For example,

.. code-block:: xml

   <launch>
     <log message="$(eval 'ceil(pi)')" />
   </launch>

Related PR: `ros2/launch#557 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/pull/557>`_

Boolean substitutions
"""""""""""""""""""""

New substitutions ``NotSubstitution``, ``AndSubstitution``, and ``OrSubstitution`` provide a convenient way to perform logical operations, for example

.. code-block:: xml

   <launch>
     <let name="p" value="true" />
     <let name="q" value="false" />
     <group if="$(or $(var p) $(var q))">
       <log message="The first condition is true" />
     </group>
     <group unless="$(and $(var p) $(var q))">
       <log message="The second condition is false" />
     </group>
     <group if="$(not $(var q))">
       <log message="The third condition is true" />
     </group>
   </launch>

New actions
"""""""""""

* ``AppendEnvironmentVariable`` appends a value to an existing environment variable.

  * Related PR: `ros2/launch#543 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/pull/543>`_

* ``ResetLaunchConfigurations`` resets any configuration applied to the launch configuration.

  * Related PR: `ros2/launch#515 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/pull/515>`_

launch_ros
^^^^^^^^^^

Passing ROS arguments to node actions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

It is now possible to provide `ROS-specific node arguments <../../How-To-Guides/Node-arguments>` directly, without needing to use ``args`` with a leading ``--ros-args`` flag:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: XML

    .. code-block:: xml

      <launch>
        <node pkg="demo_nodes_cpp" exec="talker" ros_args="--log-level debug" />
      </launch>

   .. group-tab:: YAML

      .. code-block:: yaml

        launch:
        - node:
            pkg: demo_nodes_cpp
            exec: talker
            ros_args: '--log-level debug'

The corresponding parameter for the ``Node`` action in Python launch files is ``ros_arguments``:

.. code-block:: python

  from launch import LaunchDescription
  import launch_ros.actions

  def generate_launch_description():
      return LaunchDescription([
          launch_ros.actions.Node(
              package='demo_nodes_cpp',
              executable='talker',
              ros_arguments=['--log-level', 'debug'],
          ),
      ])

Related PRs: `ros2/launch_ros#249 <https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros/pull/249>`_ and `ros2/launch_ros#253 <https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros/pull/253>`_.

Frontend support for composable nodes
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We can now start node containers and load components into them from frontend launch files, for example:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: XML

    .. code-block:: xml

       <launch>
         <node_container pkg="rclcpp_components" exec="component_container" name="my_container" namespace="">
           <composable_node pkg="composition" plugin="composition::Talker" name="talker" />
         </node_container>
         <load_composable_node target="my_container">
           <composable_node pkg="composition" plugin="composition::Listener" name="listener" />
         </load_composable_node>
       </launch>

   .. group-tab:: YAML

      .. code-block:: yaml

         launch:
           - node_container:
               pkg: rclcpp_components
               exec: component_container
               name: my_container
               namespace: ''
               composable_node:
                 - pkg: composition
                   plugin: composition::Talker
                   name: talker
           - load_composable_node:
               target: my_container
               composable_node:
                 - pkg: composition
                   plugin: composition::Listener
                   name: listener

Related PR: `ros2/launch_ros#235 <https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros/pull/235>`_

Parameter substitution
""""""""""""""""""""""

The new ``ParameterSubstitution`` lets you substitute the value of a parameter set previously in launch with the ``SetParameter`` action.
For example,

.. code-block:: xml

   <launch>
     <set_parameter name="foo" value="bar" />
     <log message="Parameter foo has value $(param foo)" />
   </launch>

Related PR: `ros2/launch_ros#297 <https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros/pull/297>`_

New actions
"""""""""""

* ``RosTimer`` acts like the launch ``TimerAction``, but uses a ROS clock (so it can use simulation time, for example).

  * Related PRs: `ros2/launch_ros#244 <https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros/pull/244>`_ and `ros2/launch_ros#264 <https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros/pull/264>`_

* ``SetParametersFromFile`` passes a ROS parameters file to all nodes in a launch file (including node components).

  * Related PRs: `ros2/launch_ros#260 <https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros/pull/260>`_ and `ros2/launch_ros#281 <https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros/pull/281>`_

SROS2 Security enclaves now support Certificate Revocation Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) are a concept where particular certificates can be revoked before their expiration.
As of Humble, it is now possible to put a CRL in an SROS2 security enclave and have it be honored.
See `the SROS2 tutorials <https://github.com/ros2/sros2/blob/humble/SROS2_Linux.md#certificate-revocation-lists>`__ for an example of how to use it.

Content Filtered Topics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Content Filtered Topics supports a more sophisticated subscription that indicates the subscriber does not want to necessarily see all values of each instance published under the Topic.
Content Filtered Topics can be used to request content-based subscriptions when underlying RMW implementation supports this feature.

.. list-table:: RMW Content Filtered Topics support
   :widths: 25 25

   * - rmw_fastrtps
     - supported
   * - rmw_connextdds
     - supported
   * - rmw_cyclonedds
     - not supported

To learn more, see the `content_filtering <https://github.com/ros2/examples/blob/humble/rclcpp/topics/minimal_subscriber/content_filtering.cpp>`_ examples.

Related design PR: `ros2/design#282 <https://github.com/ros2/design/pull/282>`_.

ros2cli
^^^^^^^

``ros2 launch`` has a ``--launch-prefix`` argument
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This allows passing a prefix to all executables in a launch file, which is useful in many debugging situations.
See the associated `pull request <https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros/pull/254>`__, as well as the :ref:`tutorial <launch-prefix-example>` for more information.

Relatedly, the ``--launch-prefix-filter`` command-line option was added to selectively add the prefix from ``--launch-prefix`` to executables.
See the `pull request <https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros/pull/261>`__ for more information.

``ros2 topic echo`` has a ``--flow-style`` argument
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This allows the user to force ``flow style`` for the YAML representation of data on a topic.
Without this option, the output from ``ros2 topic echo /tf_static`` could look something like:

.. code-block::

  transforms:
  - header:
      stamp:
        sec: 1651172841
        nanosec: 433705575
      frame_id: single_rrbot_link3
    child_frame_id: single_rrbot_camera_link
    transform:
      translation:
        x: 0.05
        y: 0.0
        z: 0.9
      rotation:
        x: 0.0
        y: 0.0
        z: 0.0
        w: 1.0

With this option, the output would look something like:

.. code-block::

  transforms: [{header: {stamp: {sec: 1651172841, nanosec: 433705575}, frame_id: single_rrbot_link3}, child_frame_id: single_rrbot_camera_link, transform: {translation: {x: 0.05, y: 0.0, z: 0.9}, rotation: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, w: 1.0}}}]

See the `PyYAML documentation <https://pyyaml.docsforge.com/master/documentation/#dictionaries-without-nested-collections-are-not-dumped-correctly>`__ for more information.

``ros2 topic echo`` can filter data based on message contents
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This allows the user to only print out data on a topic that matches a certain Python expression.
For instance, using the following argument will only print out string messages that start with 'foo':

.. code-block::

   ros2 topic echo --filter 'm.data.startswith("foo")` /chatter

See the `pull request <https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/pull/654>`__ for more information.


rviz2
^^^^^

Apply textures to arbitrary triangle lists
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We've added `the ability to apply textures defined via URI to arbitrary triangle lists using UV Coordinates <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/pull/719>`__.
Now we can create a gradient pull from a texture map instead of the default grayscale.
This will enable complex coloring of markers.
To use this, you should use the ``visualization_msgs/Marker.msg`` and fill the ``texture_resource``, ``texture``, ``uv_coordinates`` and ``mesh_file`` fields.
You can find more information `here <https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/pull/153>`__.

.. image:: images/triangle_marker_with_gradient.png

Visualization of mass properties (including inertia)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We also added the ability to visualize inertias. To do this, you select enable 'Inertia' in the 'Mass Properties' under the robot model:

.. image:: images/rviz_mass_inertia.png

You can see an image of an inertia below.

.. image:: images/tb4_inertia.png

Visualize YUV images in RViz
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

It is now possible to directly visualize YUV images inside of RViz, rather than having to convert to RGB first.
See `ros2/rviz#701 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/pull/701>`__ for details.

Allow rendering of objects > 100 meters
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

By default, RViz only renders objects that are within 100 meters of a camera.
A new configuration property called "Far Plane Distance" in the rviz camera plugin allows that rendering distance to be configured.

.. image:: images/rviz2-far-plane-distance.png

See `ros2/rviz#849 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/pull/849>`__ for more information.

Changes since the Galactic release
----------------------------------

common_interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support Textures and Embedded Meshes for Marker Messages
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

These two additions will improve the ability to both visualize data in new ways with standard messages and, simultaneously, enable the ability to track this data in rosbag.

**Textures** bring the addition of three new fields to markers:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Texture resource is a special URI that can either reference a texture file in
   # a format acceptable to (resource retriever)[https://index.ros.org/p/resource_retriever/]
   # or an embedded texture via a string matching the format:
   #   "embedded://texture_name"
   string texture_resource
   # An image to be loaded into the rendering engine as the texture for this marker.
   # This will be used iff texture_resource is set to embedded.
   sensor_msgs/CompressedImage texture
   # Location of each vertex within the texture; in the range: [0.0-1.0]
   UVCoordinate[] uv_coordinates

RViz will fully support texture rendering through the embedded format.

To those familiar with ``mesh_resource``, ``resource_retriever`` should be familiar.
This will allow the programmer to choose where they want to load data from, either a local file or a networked file.
In the interest of being able to record all data in a rosbag, the ability to embed the texture image is included.

**Meshes** were modified in a similar way to add the ability to embed a raw Mesh file for the purpose of recording and are modified in a similar way. The Meshfile message has two fields:

.. code-block:: bash

   # The filename is used for both debug purposes and to provide a file extension
   # for whatever parser is used.
   string filename

   # This stores the raw text of the mesh file.
   uint8[] data

The embedded ``Meshfile`` message is not yet supported in implementation.

Related PRs: `ros2/common_interfaces#153 <https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/pull/153>`_ `ros2/rviz#719 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/pull/719>`_

Added ``PRISM`` type to SolidPrimitive
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``SolidPrimitive`` message had a new ``PRISM`` type added, along with the appropriate metadata.
See `ros2/common_interfaces#167 <https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/pull/167>`_ for more information.

rmw
^^^

``struct`` type name suffix changed from ``_t`` to ``_s``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To avoid type name duplication errors between ``struct`` type names and their ``typedef``-ed aliases when generating code documentation, the suffix for all ``struct`` type names has been changed from ``_t`` to ``_s``.
Aliases with ``_t`` suffixes remain in place.
Thus, this change is a breaking change only for code that uses full ``struct`` type specifiers i.e. ``struct type_name_t``.

See `ros2/rmw#313 <https://github.com/ros2/rmw/pull/313>`__ for more details.

rmw_connextdds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use Connext 6 by default
""""""""""""""""""""""""

By default, Humble Hawksbill uses Connext 6.0.1 as the DDS implementation for ``rmw_connextdds``.
It is still possible to use Connext 5.3.1 with ``rmw_connextdds``, but it must be rebuilt from source.

rcl
^^^

``struct`` type name suffix changed from ``_t`` to ``_s``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To avoid type name duplication errors between ``struct`` type names and their ``typedef``-ed aliases when generating code documentation, the suffix for all ``struct`` type names has been changed from ``_t`` to ``_s``.
Aliases with ``_t`` suffixes remain in place.
Thus, this change is a breaking change only for code that uses full ``struct`` type specifiers i.e. ``struct type_name_t``.

See `ros2/rcl#932 <https://github.com/ros2/rcl/pull/932>`__ for more details.

ROS_DISABLE_LOANED_MESSAGES environment variable added
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This environment variable can be used to disable loaned messages support, independently if the rmw supports them or not.
For more details, see the guide :doc:`Disabling Zero Copy Loaned Messages <../How-To-Guides/Disabling-ZeroCopy-loaned-messages>`.

rclcpp
^^^^^^

Support Type Adaption for Publishers and Subscriptions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

After defining a type adapter, custom data structures can be used directly by publishers and subscribers, which helps to avoid additional work for the programmer and potential sources of errors.
This is especially useful when working with complex data types, such as when converting OpenCV's ``cv::Mat`` to ROS's ``sensor_msgs/msg/Image`` type.

Here is an example of a type adapter that converts ``std_msgs::msg::String`` to ``std::string``:

.. code-block:: cpp

   template<>
   struct rclcpp::TypeAdapter<
      std::string,
      std_msgs::msg::String
   >
   {
     using is_specialized = std::true_type;
     using custom_type = std::string;
     using ros_message_type = std_msgs::msg::String;

     static
     void
     convert_to_ros_message(
       const custom_type & source,
       ros_message_type & destination)
     {
       destination.data = source;
     }

     static
     void
     convert_to_custom(
       const ros_message_type & source,
       custom_type & destination)
     {
       destination = source.data;
     }
   };

And an example of how the type adapter can be used:

.. code-block:: cpp

   using MyAdaptedType = TypeAdapter<std::string, std_msgs::msg::String>;

   // Publish a std::string
   auto pub = node->create_publisher<MyAdaptedType>(...);
   std::string custom_msg = "My std::string"
   pub->publish(custom_msg);

   // Pass a std::string to a subscription's callback
   auto sub = node->create_subscription<MyAdaptedType>(
     "topic",
     10,
     [](const std::string & msg) {...});

To learn more, see the `publisher <https://github.com/ros2/examples/blob/b83b18598b198b4a5ba44f9266c1bb39a393fa17/rclcpp/topics/minimal_publisher/member_function_with_type_adapter.cpp>`_ and `subscription <https://github.com/ros2/examples/blob/b83b18598b198b4a5ba44f9266c1bb39a393fa17/rclcpp/topics/minimal_subscriber/member_function_with_type_adapter.cpp>`_ examples, as well as a more complex `demo <https://github.com/ros2/demos/pull/482>`_.
For more details, see `REP 2007 <https://ros.org/reps/rep-2007.html>`_.

``Client::asnyc_send_request(request)`` returns a ``std::future`` instead of a ``std::shared_future``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This change was implemented in `rclcpp#1734 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1734>`_.
This breaks API, as ``std::future::get()`` methods extracts the value from the future.
That means, if that method is called for a second time it will throw an exception.
That doesn't happen with a ``std::shared_future``, as its ``get()`` method returns a ``const &``.
Example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto future = client->async_send_request(req);
    ...
    do_something_with_response(future.get());
    ...
    do_something_else_with_response(future.get());  // this will throw an exception now!!

should be updated to:

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto future = client->async_send_request(req);
    ...
    auto response = future.get();
    do_something_with_response(response);
    ...
    do_something_else_with_response(response);

If a shared future is needed, the ``std::future::share()`` method can be used.

``wait_for_all_acked`` method added to ``Publisher``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This new method will block until all messages in the publisher queue are acked by the matching subscriptions or the specified timeout expires.
It is only useful for reliable publishers, as in the case of best effort QoS there's no acking.
Examples:

.. code-block:: cpp

   auto pub = node->create_publisher<std_msgs::msg::String>(...);
   ...
   pub->publish(my_msg);
   ...
   pub->wait_for_all_acked(); // or pub->wait_for_all_acked(timeout)

For a more complete example, see `here <https://github.com/ros2/examples/blob/humble/rclcpp/topics/minimal_publisher/member_function_with_wait_for_all_acked.cpp>`__.

``get_callback_groups`` method removed from ``NodeBase`` and ``Node`` classes
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``for_each_callback_group()`` method has replaced ``get_callback_groups()`` by providing a thread-safe way to access ``callback_groups_`` vector.
``for_each_callback_group()`` accepts a function as an argument, iterates over the stored callback groups, and calls the passed function to ones that are valid.

For more details, please refer to this `pull request <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1723>`_.

``add_to_wait_set`` method from ``Waitable`` class changes its return type from ``bool`` to ``void``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Before, classes derived from ``Waitable`` overriding ``add_to_wait_set`` were returning false when failing to add elements to the wait set, so the caller had to check this return value and throw or handle the error.
This error handling should now be done directly on ``add_to_wait_set`` method, throwing if necessary.
It is not required to return anything if no errors happened.
Thus, this is a breaking change for downstream uses of ``Waitable``.

See `ros2/rclcpp#1612 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1612>`__ for more details.

``get_notify_guard_condition`` method return type from ``NodeBaseInterface`` class changed
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Now ``rclcpp`` uses the ``GuardCondition`` class wrapper around ``rcl_guard_condition_t``, so ``get_notify_guard_condition`` returns a reference to the node's ``rclcpp::GuardCondition``.
Thus, this is a breaking change for downstream uses of ``NodeBaseInterface`` and ``NodeBase``.

See `ros2/rclcpp#1612 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1612>`__ for more details.

``sleep_until`` and ``sleep_for`` methods added to ``Clock``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Two new methods were added to allow sleeping on a particular clock in `ros2/rclcpp#1814 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1814>`__ and `ros2/rclcpp#1828 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1828>`__.
``Clock::sleep_until`` will suspend the current thread until the clock reaches a particular time.
``Clock::sleep_for`` will suspend the current thread until the clock advances a certain amount of time from when the method was called.
Both methods will wake early if the ``Context`` is shutdown.

rclcpp_lifecycle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Active and deactivate transitions of publishers will be triggered automatically
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Before, users needed to override ``LifecylceNode::on_activate()`` and ``LifecylceNode::on_deactivate()`` and call the similarly named methods on ``LifecyclePublisher`` to make the transition actually happen.
Now, ``LifecylceNode`` provides a default interface of these methods that already do this.
See the implementation of the ``lifecycle_talker`` node `here <https://github.com/ros2/demos/tree/humble/lifecycle>`__.

rclpy
^^^^^

Managed nodes
"""""""""""""

Lifecycle nodes support was added to rclpy.
A complete demo can be found `here <https://github.com/ros2/demos/tree/humble/lifecycle_py>`__.

``wait_for_all_acked`` method added to ``Publisher``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Similar to the feature added to rclcpp.

``sleep_until`` and ``sleep_for`` methods added to ``Clock``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Two new methods were added to allow sleeping on a particular clock in `ros2/rclpy#858 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/pull/858>`__ and `ros2/rclpy#864 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/pull/864>`__.
``sleep_until`` will suspend the current thread until the clock reaches a particular time.
``sleep_for`` will suspend the current thread until the clock advances a certain amount of time from when the method was called.
Both methods will wake early if the ``Context`` is shutdown.

ros1_bridge
^^^^^^^^^^^

Since there is no official ROS 1 distribution on Ubuntu Jammy and forward, ``ros1_bridge`` is now compatible with the Ubuntu-packaged versions of ROS 1.
More details about using ``ros1_bridge`` with Jammy packages are available in `the how-to guides <../How-To-Guides/Using-ros1_bridge-Jammy-upstream.rst>`__.

ros2cli
^^^^^^^

``ros2`` commands disable output buffering by default
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Prior to this release, running a command like

.. code-block::

  ros2 echo /chatter | grep "Hello"

would not print any data until the output buffer was full.
Users could work around this by setting ``PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1``, but that was not very user friendly.

Instead, all ``ros2`` commands now do line-buffering by default, so commands like the above work as soon as a newline is printed.
To disable this behavior and use default python buffering rules, use the option ``--use-python-default-buffering``.
See the `original issue <https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/595>`__ and the `pull request <https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/pull/659>`__ for more information.

``ros2 topic pub`` will wait for one matching subscription when using ``--times/--once/-1``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When using ``--times/--once/-1`` flags, ``ros2 topic pub`` will wait for one matching subscription to be found before starting to publish.
This avoids the issue of the ros2cli node starting to publish before discovering a matching subscription, which results in some of the first messages being lost.
This is particularly unexpected when using a reliable qos profile.

The number of matching subscriptions to wait before starting publishing can be configured with the ``-w/--wait-matching-subscriptions`` flags, e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 topic pub -1 -w 3 /chatter std_msgs/msg/String "{data: 'foo'}"

to wait for three matching subscriptions before starting to publish.

``-w`` can also be used independently of ``--times/--once/-1`` but it only defaults to one when combined with them, otherwise the ``-w`` default is zero.

See https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/pull/642 for more details.

``ros2 param dump`` default output changed
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

  * ``--print`` option for dump command was `deprecated <https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/pull/638>`_.

    It prints to stdout by default:

    .. code-block:: bash

      ros2 param dump /my_node_name

  * ``--output-dir`` option for dump command was `deprecated <https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/pull/638>`_.

    To dump parameters to a file, run:

    .. code-block:: bash

      ros2 param dump /my_node_name > my_node_name.yaml

``ros2 param set`` now accepts more YAML syntax
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Previously, attempting to set a string like "off" to a parameter that was of string type did not work.
That's because ``ros2 param set`` interprets the command-line arguments as YAML, and YAML considers "off" to be a boolean type.
As of https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/pull/684 , ``ros2 param set`` now accepts the YAML escape sequence of "!!str off" to ensure that the value is considered a string.

``ros2 pkg create`` can automatically generate a LICENSE file
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If the ``--license`` flag is passed to ``ros2 pkg create``, and the license is one of the known licenses, ``ros2 pkg create`` will now automatically generate a LICENSE file in the root of the package.
For a list of known licenses, run ``ros2 pkg create --license ? <package_name>``.
See the associated `pull request <https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/pull/650>`__ for more information.

robot_state_publisher
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added ``frame_prefix`` parameter
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
A new parameter ``frame_prefix`` was added in `ros/robot_state_publisher#159 <https://github.com/ros/robot_state_publisher/pull/159>`__.
This parameter is a string which is prepended to all frame names published by ``robot_state_publisher``.
Similar to ``tf_prefix`` in the original ``tf`` library in ROS 1, this parameter can be used to publish the same robot description multiple times with different frame names.

Removal of deprecated ``use_tf_static`` parameter
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The deprecated ``use_tf_static`` parameter has been removed from ``robot_state_publisher``.
This means that static transforms are unconditionally published to the ``/tf_static`` topic, and that the static transforms are published in a ``transient_local`` Quality of Service.
This was the default behavior, and the behavior which the ``tf2_ros::TransformListener`` class expected before, so most code will not have to be changed.
Any code that was relying on ``robot_state_publisher`` to periodically publish static transforms to ``/tf`` will have to be updated to subscribe to ``/tf_static`` as a ``transient_local`` subscription instead.


rosidl_cmake
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deprecation of ``rosidl_target_interfaces()``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The CMake function ``rosidl_target_interfaces()`` has been deprecated, and now issues a CMake warning when called.
Users wanting to use messages/services/actions in the same ROS package that generated them should instead call ``rosidl_get_typesupport_target()`` and then ``target_link_libraries()`` to make their targets depend on the returned typesupport target.
See https://github.com/ros2/rosidl/pull/606 for more details, and https://github.com/ros2/demos/pull/529 for an example of using the new function.


rviz2
^^^^^

* `improved the efficiency of 3-bytes pixel formats <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/pull/743>`__
* `changed the way inertias are computed to use ignition math rather than Ogre's math libraries <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/pull/751>`__.


geometry2
^^^^^^^^^

Deprecation of TF2Error::NO_ERROR, etc
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``tf2`` library uses an enumeration called ``TF2Error`` to return errors.
Unfortunately, one of the enumerators in there is called ``NO_ERROR``, which conflicts with a macro on Windows.
To remedy this, a new set of enumerators in ``TF2Error`` were created, each with a ``TF2`` prefix.
The previous enumerators are still available, but are now deprecated and will print a deprecation warning if used.
All code that uses the ``TF2Error`` enumerator should be updated to use the new ``TF2`` prefixed errors.
See https://github.com/ros2/geometry2/pull/349 for more details.

More intuitive command-line arguments for static_transform_publisher
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``static_transform_publisher`` program used to take arguments like: ``ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 foo bar``.
The first three numbers are the translation x, y, and z, the next 4 are the quaternion x, y, z, and w, and the last two arguments are the parent and child frame IDs.
While this worked, it had a couple of problems:

* The user had to specify *all* of the arguments, even if only setting one number
* Reading the command-line to figure out what it was publishing was tricky

To fix both of these issues, the command-line handling has been changed to use flags instead, and all flags except for ``--frame-id`` and ``--child-frame-id`` are optional.
Thus, the above command-line can be simplified to: ``ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher --frame-id foo --child-frame-id bar``
To change just the translation x, the command-line would be: ``ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher --x 1.5 --frame-id foo --child-frame-id bar``.

The old-style arguments are still allowed in this release, but are deprecated and will print a warning.
They will be removed in future releases.
See https://github.com/ros2/geometry2/pull/392 for more details.

Transform listener spin thread no longer executes node callbacks
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``tf2_ros::TransformListener`` no longer spins on the provided node object.
Instead, it creates a callback group to execute callbacks on the entities it creates internally.
This means if you have set the parameter ``spin_thread=true`` when creating a transform listener, you
can no longer depend on your own callbacks to be executed.
You must call a ``spin`` function on your node (e.g. ``rclcpp::spin``), or add your node to your own executor.

rosbag2
^^^^^^^

New playback and recording controls
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Several pull requests have been added to enhance the user's control over playback of bags.
Pull request `931 <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/pull/931>`_ adds the ability to specify a time stamp to begin playing from.
Due to pull request `789 <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/pull/789>`_ it is now possible to delay the start of playback by a specified interval.

Relatedly, ``rosbag2`` has gained new ways for users to control playback as it is happening.
Pull request `847 <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/pull/847>`_ adds keyboard controls for pausing, resuming, and playing the next message during playback from a terminal.
It is also possible to start playback paused thanks to pull requests `905 <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/pull/905>`_ and `904 <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/pull/904>`_, which makes it easy for the user to initiate playback and then step through messages, such as when debugging a pipeline.
Pull request `836 <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/pull/836>`_ adds an interface for seeking within bags, allowing the user to move around within a bag during playback.

Finally, a new snapshot mode has been added to recording in pull request `851 <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/pull/851>`_.
This mode, useful for incident recording, allows recording to begin filling up buffers, but not begin writing data to disc until a service is called.

Burst-mode playback
"""""""""""""""""""

While the playback of data from a bag in real-time is the most well-known use case for bag files, there are situations where you want the data in the bag as fast as possible.
With pull request `977 <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/pull/977>`_, ``rosbag2`` has gained the ability to "burst" data from the bag.
In burst mode, the data is played back as fast as possible.
This is useful in applications such as machine learning.

Zero-Copy playback
""""""""""""""""""

By default, if loaned message can be used, playback messages are published as loaned message.
This can help to reduce the number of data copies, so there is a greater benefit for sending big data.
Pull request `981 <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/pull/981>`_ adds ``--disable-loan-message`` option for playback.

Wait for an acknowledgment
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This new option will wait until all published messages are acknowledged by all subscribers or until the timeout elapses in millisecond before play is terminated.
Especially for the case of sending message with big size in a short time.
This option is valid only if the publisher's QOS profile is RELIABLE.
Pull request `951 <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/pull/951>`_ adds ``--wait-for-all-acked`` option for playback.

Bag editing
"""""""""""

``rosbag2`` is taking steps towards enabling the editing of bags, such as removing all messages for one topic or merging multiple bags into a single bag.
Pull request `921 <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/pull/921>`_ adds bag rewriting and the ``ros2 bag convert`` verb.

Other changes
"""""""""""""

Pull request `925 <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/pull/925>`_ makes ``rosbag2`` ignore "leaf topics" (topics without a publisher) when recording.
These topics will no longer be automatically added to the bag.

Known Issues
------------

* When `installing ROS 2 on an Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy host <../../humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html>`__ it is important to update your system before installing ROS 2 packages.
  It is *particularly* important to make sure that ``systemd`` and ``udev`` are updated to the latest available version otherwise installing ``ros-humble-desktop``, which depends on ``libudev1``, could cause the removal of system critical packages.
  Details can be found in `ros2/ros2#1272 <https://github.com/ros2/ros2/issues/1272>`_ and `Launchpad #1974196 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1974196>`_

* When ROS 2 apt repositories are available, ROS 1 packages in Ubuntu are not installable.  See the :doc:`ros1_bridge on Ubuntu Jammy <../How-To-Guides/Using-ros1_bridge-Jammy-upstream>` document for more information.

* Some major Linux distributions have started patching Python to install packages to ``/usr/local``, which is breaking some parts of ``ament_package`` and builds with ``colcon``.
  In particular, using Ubuntu Jammy with ``setuptools`` installed from pip will manifest this misbehavior, and is therefore not recommended.
  There is currently a `proposed solution <https://github.com/colcon/colcon-core/pull/512>`_ which requires further testing before widespread release.

* ROS 2 bags that are split by size or duration are not played correctly.
  Only the last bag recorded is played.
  It is recommended to avoid splitting bags by size or duration.
  Details can be found in `ros2/rosbag2#966 <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/issues/966>`__.
