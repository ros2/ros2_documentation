New features in this ROS 2 release
----------------------------------

Ability to specify per-logger log levels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is now possible to specify different logging levels for different loggers on the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker --ros-args --log-level WARN --log-level talker:=DEBUG

The above command sets a global log level of WARN, but sets the log level of the talker node messages to DEBUG.
The ``--log-level`` command-line option can be passed an arbitrary number of times to set different log levels for each logger.

Ability to configure logging directory through environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is now possible to configure the logging directory through two environment variables: ``ROS_LOG_DIR`` and ``ROS_HOME``.
The logic is as follows:

* Use ``$ROS_LOG_DIR`` if ``ROS_LOG_DIR`` is set and not empty.
* Otherwise, use ``$ROS_HOME/log``, using ``~/.ros`` for ``ROS_HOME`` if not set or if empty.

Thus the default value stays the same: ``~/.ros/log``.

Related PRs: `ros2/rcl_logging#53 <https://github.com/ros2/rcl_logging/pull/53>`_ and `ros2/launch#460 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/pull/460>`_.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  ROS_LOG_DIR=/tmp/foo ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

Will place all logs in ``/tmp/foo``.

.. code-block:: bash

  ROS_HOME=/path/to/home ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

Will place all logs in ``/path/to/home/log``.

Ability to invoke ``rosidl`` pipeline outside CMake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is now straightforward to invoke the ``rosidl`` interface generation pipeline outside CMake.
Source code generators and interface definition translators are accessible through a unified command line interface.

For example, given a ``Demo`` message in some ``demo`` package like:

.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir -p demo/msg
  cd demo
  cat << EOF > msg/Demo.msg
  std_msgs/Header header
  geometry_msgs/Twist twist
  geometry_msgs/Accel accel
  EOF

it is easy to generate C, C++, and Python support source code:

.. code-block:: bash

  rosidl generate -o gen -t c -t cpp -t py -I$(ros2 pkg prefix --share std_msgs)/.. \
    -I$(ros2 pkg prefix --share geometry_msgs)/.. demo msg/Demo.msg

Generated source code will be put in the ``gen`` directory.

One may also translate the message definition to a different format for a third-party code generation tool to consume:

.. code-block:: bash

  rosidl translate -o gen --to idl -I$(ros2 pkg prefix --share std_msgs)/.. \
    -I$(ros2 pkg prefix --share geometry_msgs)/.. demo msg/Demo.msg

The translated message definition will be put in the ``gen`` directory.

Note that these tools generate sources but do not build it -- that responsibility is still on the caller.
This is a first step towards enabling ``rosidl`` interface generation in build systems other than CMake.
See the `design document <https://github.com/ros2/design/pull/310>`_ for further reference and next steps.

Externally configure QoS at start-up
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is now possible to externally configure the QoS settings for a node at start-up time.
QoS settings are **not** configurable during runtime; they are only configurable at start-up.
Node authors must opt-in to enable changing QoS settings at start-up.
If the feature is enabled on a node, then QoS settings can be set with ROS parameters when a node first starts.

`Demos in C++ and Python can be found here. <https://github.com/ros2/demos/tree/a66f0e894841a5d751bce6ded4983acb780448cf/quality_of_service_demo#qos-overrides>`_

See the `design document for more details <http://design.ros2.org/articles/qos_configurability.html>`_.

Note, user code handling parameter changes with registered callbacks should avoid rejecting updates for unknown parameters.
It was considered bad practice prior to Galactic, but with externally configurable QoS enabled it will result in a hard failure.

Related PRs: `ros2/rclcpp#1408 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1408>`_ and `ros2/rclpy#635 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/pull/635>`_

Python point_cloud2 utilities available
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several utilities for interacting with `PointCloud2 messages <https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/galactic/sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2.msg>`__ in Python were `ported to ROS 2 <https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/pull/128>`__.
These utilities allow one to get a list of points from a PointCloud2 message (``read_points`` and ``read_points_list``), and to create a PointCloud2 message from a list of points (``create_cloud`` and ``create_cloud_xyz32``).

An example of creating PointCloud 2 message, then reading it back:

.. code-block:: python

  import sensor_msgs_py.point_cloud2
  from std_msgs.msg import Header

  pointlist = [[0.0, 0.1, 0.2]]

  pointcloud = sensor_msgs_py.point_cloud2.create_cloud_xyz32(Header(frame_id='frame'), pointlist)

  for point in sensor_msgs_py.point_cloud2.read_points(pointcloud):
      print(point)

RViz2 Time Panel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Rviz2 Time Panel, which shows the current Wall and ROS time, along with the elapsed Wall and ROS time, has been `ported to RViz2 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/pull/599>`__.
To enable the Time Panel, click on Panels -> Add New Panel, and select "Time".
A panel that looks like the following will appear:

.. image:: rviz2-time-panel-2021-05-17.png

ros2 topic echo can print serialized data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When debugging middleware issues, it can be useful to see the raw serialized data that the RMW is sending.
The `--raw command-line flag <https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/pull/470>`__ was added to ``ros2 topic echo`` to show this data.
To see this in action, run the following commands.

Terminal 1:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ros2 topic pub /chatter std_msgs/msg/String "data: 'hello'"

Terminal 2:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ros2 topic echo --raw /chatter
  b'\x00\x01\x00\x00\x06\x00\x00\x00hello\x00\x00\x00'
  ---

Get the YAML representation of messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is now possible to get a YAML representation of all messages in C++ using the `to_yaml <https://github.com/ros2/rosidl/issues/523>`__ function.
An example of code that prints out the YAML representation:

.. code-block:: c++

  #include <cstdio>

  #include <std_msgs/msg/string.hpp>

  int main()
  {
    std_msgs::msg::String msg;
    msg.data = "hello world";
    printf("%s", rosidl_generator_traits::to_yaml(msg).c_str());
    return 0;
  }

Ability to load parameter files at runtime through the ros2 command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ROS 2 has long had the ability to specify parameter values at startup (through command-line arguments or a YAML file), and to dump current parameters out to a file (through ``ros2 param dump``).
Galactic adds the ability to `load parameter values at runtime <https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/pull/590>`__ from a YAML file using the ``ros2 param load`` verb.
For example:

Terminal 1:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp parameter_blackboard

Terminal 2:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ros2 param set /parameter_blackboard foo bar  # sets 'foo' parameter to value 'bar'
  $ ros2 param dump /parameter_blackboard  # dumps current value of parameters to ./parameter_blackboard.yaml
  $ ros2 param set /parameter_blackboard foo different  # sets 'foo' parameter to value 'different'
  $ ros2 param load /parameter_blackboard ./parameter_blackboard.yaml  # reloads previous state of parameters, 'foo' is back to 'bar'

Tools to check for QoS incompatibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Built on top of new QoS compatibility check APIs, ``ros2doctor`` and ``rqt_graph`` can now detect and report QoS incompatibilities between publishers and subscriptions.

Given a publisher and a subscription with `incompatible QoS settings <../../Concepts/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings>`:

Terminal 1:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ros2 run demo_nodes_py talker_qos -n 1000  # i.e. best_effort publisher

Terminal 2:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener_qos --reliable -n 1000  # i.e. reliable subscription

``ros2doctor`` reports:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ros2 doctor --report
  # ...
     QOS COMPATIBILITY LIST
  topic [type]            : /chatter [std_msgs/msg/String]
  publisher node          : talker_qos
  subscriber node         : listener_qos
  compatibility status    : ERROR: Best effort publisher and reliable subscription;
  # ...

while ``rqt_graph`` shows:

.. image:: images/rqt_graph-qos-incompatibility-2021-05-17.png

Related PRs: `ros2/ros2cli#621 <https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/pull/621>`_, `ros-visualization/rqt_graph#61 <https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_graph/pull/61>`_

Use launch substitutions in parameter files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just like ``rosparam`` tags in ROS 1 ``roslaunch``, ``launch_ros`` can now evaluate substitutions in parameter files.

For example, given some ``parameter_file_with_substitutions.yaml`` like the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

  /**:
    ros__parameters:
      launch_date: $(command date)

Set ``allow_substs`` to ``True`` to get substitutions evaluated upon ``Node`` launch:

.. code-block:: python

  import launch
  import launch_ros.parameter_descriptions
  import launch_ros.actions

  def generate_launch_description():
      return launch.LaunchDescription([
          launch_ros.actions.Node(
              package='demo_nodes_cpp',
              executable='parameter_blackboard',
              parameters=[
                  launch_ros.parameter_descriptions.ParameterFile(
                      param_file='parameter_file_with_substitutions.yaml',
                      allow_substs=True)
              ]
          )
      ])

XML launch files also support this.

.. code-block:: xml

  <launch>
    <node pkg="demo_nodes_cpp" exec="parameter_blackboard">
      <param from="parameter_file_with_substitutions.yaml" allow_substs="true"/>
    </node>
  </launch>

Support for unique network flows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Applications may now require UDP/TCP and IP-based RMW implementations to provide unique *network flows* (i.e. unique `Differentiated Services Code Points <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2474>`_ and/or unique `IPv6 Flow Labels <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6437>`_ and/or unique ports in IP packet headers) for publishers and subscriptions, enabling QoS specifications for these IP streams in network architectures that support such a feature, like 5G networks.

To see this in action, you may run these C++ examples (to be found in the `ros2/examples <https://github.com/ros2/examples>`__ repository):

Terminal 1:

.. code-block:: bash

  ros2 run examples_rclcpp_minimal_publisher publisher_member_function_with_unique_network_flow_endpoints


Terminal 2:

.. code-block:: bash

  ros2 run examples_rclcpp_minimal_subscriber subscriber_member_function_with_unique_network_flow_endpoints


See the `Unique Network Flows design document <https://github.com/ros2/design/pull/304>`_ for further reference.

Rosbag2 New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Split recording by time
"""""""""""""""""""""""

In Foxy, you could only split bags as they were recording by the size of the bag, now you can also split by the elapsed time.
The following command will split bagfiles into 100-second chunks.

.. code-block:: bash

  ros2 bag record --all --max-bag-duration 100

ros2 bag list
"""""""""""""

This new command lists installed plugins of various types that rosbag2 uses.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ros2 bag list storage
  rosbag2_v2
  sqlite3

  $ ros2 bag list converter
  rosbag_v2_converter


Compression implementation is a plugin
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In Foxy, rosbag2 compression was hardcoded with a Zstd library implementation.
This has been rearchitected so that compression implementations are a plugin, and can be swapped out without modifying the core rosbag2 codebase.
The default plugin that ships with ``ros-galactic-rosbag2`` is still the Zstd plugin - but now more can be released and used, and by selectively installing packages Zstd could be excluded from an installation.


Compress per-message
""""""""""""""""""""

In Foxy, you could automatically compress each rosbag file as it was split (per-file compression), but now you can also specify per-message compression.

.. code-block:: bash

  ros2 bag record --all --compression-format zstd --compression-mode message


Rosbag2 Python API
"""""""""""""""""""""

A new package ``rosbag2_py`` has been released in Galactic, which provides a Python API.
This package is a ``pybind11`` binding around the C++ API.
As of the initial Galactic release, it does not yet expose all functionality available via the ``rosbag2_cpp`` API, but it is the sole connection for the ``ros2 bag`` CLI tool, so a good deal of functionality is available.


performance testing package and performance improvements
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A thorough performance analysis project was performed on rosbag2 since the Foxy release.
The full initial report is available at https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/blob/galactic/rosbag2_performance/rosbag2_performance_benchmarking/docs/rosbag2_performance_improvements.pdf .
The package ``rosbag2_performance_benchmarking`` provides tools to run performance analyses, especially on recording, which helps us maintain and improve the performance of rosbag2.

Following this report, key work was done do improve the performance to a much more usable state for actual robot workflows.
To highlight a key metric - in a high bandwidth stress test (200Mbps), the Foxy release dropped up to 70% of messages, whereas the Galactic version was approximately 100% retention.
Please see the linked report for more details.

``--regex`` and ``--exclude`` options for topic selection
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The new recording options ``--regex`` and ``--exclude`` allow for fine-tuning the topics recorded in a bag, without having to explicitly list all topics.
These options may be used together or separately, and in conjunction with ``--all``

The following command will record only topics with "scan" in the name.

.. code-block:: bash

  ros2 bag record --regex "*scan*"

The following command will record all topics except for ones in ``/my_namespace/``

.. code-block:: bash

  ros2 bag record --all --exclude "/my_namespace/*"


``ros2 bag reindex``
""""""""""""""""""""

ROS 2 bags are represented by a directory, instead of a single file.
This directory contains a ``metadata.yaml`` file, and one or more bag files.
When the ``metadata.yaml`` file is lost or missing, ``ros2 bag reindex $bag_dir`` will attempt to reconstruct it by reading all the bag files in the directory.

Playback time control
"""""""""""""""""""""

New controls have been added for rosbag2 playback - pause & resume, change rate, and play-next.
As of the Galactic release, these controls are exposed only as services on the rosbag2 player node.
Development is in progress to expose them to keyboard controls as well in ``ros2 bag play``, but until then a user application with buttons or keyboard controls may be trivially implemented to call these services.

.. code-block:: bash

  # In one shell
  $ ros2 bag play my_bag

  # In another shell
  $ ros2 service list -t
  /rosbag2_player/get_rate [rosbag2_interfaces/srv/GetRate]
  /rosbag2_player/is_paused [rosbag2_interfaces/srv/IsPaused]
  /rosbag2_player/pause [rosbag2_interfaces/srv/Pause]
  /rosbag2_player/play_next [rosbag2_interfaces/srv/PlayNext]
  /rosbag2_player/resume [rosbag2_interfaces/srv/Resume]
  /rosbag2_player/set_rate [rosbag2_interfaces/srv/SetRate]
  /rosbag2_player/toggle_paused [rosbag2_interfaces/srv/TogglePaused]

  # Check if playback is paused
  $ ros2 service call /rosbag2_player/is_paused rosbag2_interfaces/IsPaused

  # Pause playback
  $ ros2 service call /rosbag2_player/pause rosbag2_interfaces/Pause

  # Resume playback
  $ ros2 service call /rosbag2_player/resume rosbag2_interfaces/Resume

  # Change the paused state of playback to its opposite. If playing, pauses. If paused, resumes.
  $ ros2 service call /rosbag2_player/toggle_paused rosbag2_interfaces/TogglePaused

  # Get the current playback rate
  $ ros2 service call /rosbag2_player/get_rate

  # Set the current playback rate (must be > 0)
  $ ros2 service call /rosbag2_player/set_rate rosbag2_interfaces/SetRate "rate: 0.1"

  # Play a single next message (only works while paused)
  $ ros2 service call /rosbag2_player/play_next rosbag2_interfaces/PlayNext


Playback publishes /clock
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Rosbag2 can also dictate "simulation time" by publishing to the ``/clock`` topic during playback.
The following commands will publish the clock message at a regular interval.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Publish at default rate - 40Hz
  ros2 bag play my_bag --clock

  # Publish at specific rate - 100Hz
  ros2 bag play my_bag --clock 100

Changes since the Foxy release
------------------------------

Default RMW changed to Eclipse Cyclone DDS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During the Galactic development process, the ROS 2 Technical Steering Committee `voted <https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros-2-galactic-default-middleware-announced/18064>`__ to change the default ROS middleware (RMW) to `Eclipse Cyclone DDS <https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds>`__ project of `Eclipse Foundation <https://www.eclipse.org>`__.
Without any configuration changes, users will get Eclipse Cyclone DDS by default.
Fast DDS and Connext are still Tier-1 supported RMW vendors, and users can opt-in to use one of these RMWs at their discretion by using the ``RMW_IMPLEMENTATION`` environment variable.
See the `Working with multiple RMW implementations guide <../../How-To-Guides/Working-with-multiple-RMW-implementations>` for more information.

Connext RMW changed to rmw_connextdds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new RMW for Connext called `rmw_connextdds <https://github.com/ros2/rmw_connextdds>`_ was merged for Galactic.
This RMW has better performance and fixes many of the issues with the older RMW ``rmw_connext_cpp``.

Large improvements in testing and overall quality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Galactic contains many changes that fix race conditions, plug memory leaks, and fix user reported problems.
Besides these changes, there was a concerted effort during Galactic development to improve overall quality of the system by implementing `REP 2004 <https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2004.html>`__.
The ``rclcpp`` package and all of its dependencies (which include most of the ROS 2 non-Python core packages) were brought up to `Quality Level 1 <https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2004.html#quality-level-1>`__ by:

* Having a version policy (QL1 requirement 1)
* Having a documented change control process (QL1 requirement 2)
* Documenting all features and public APIs (QL1 requirement 3)
* Adding many additional tests (QL1 requirement 4):

  * System tests for all features
  * Unit tests for all public APIs
  * Nightly performance tests
  * Code coverage at 95%

* Having all runtime dependencies of packages be at least as high as the package (QL1 requirement 5)
* Supporting all of the REP-2000 platforms (QL1 requirement 6)
* Having a vulnerability disclosure policy (QL1 requirement 7)

rmw
^^^

New API for checking QoS profile compatibility
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``rmw_qos_profile_check_compatible`` is a new function for checking the compatibility of two QoS profiles.

RMW vendors should implement this API for QoS debugging and introspection features in tools such as ``rqt_graph`` to work correctly.

ament_cmake
^^^^^^^^^^^

``ament_install_python_package()`` now installs a Python egg
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

By installing a flat Python egg, Python packages installed using ``ament_install_python_package()`` can be discovered using modules such as ``pkg_resources`` and ```importlib.metadata``. Also, additional metadata can be provided in a ``setup.cfg`` file (including entry points).

Related PR: `ament/ament_cmake#326 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/pull/326>`_

``ament_target_dependencies()`` handles SYSTEM dependencies
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Some package dependencies can now be marked as SYSTEM dependencies, helping to cope with warnings in external code. Typically, SYSTEM dependencies are also excluded from dependency calculations -- use them with care.

nav2
^^^^

Changes include, but are not limited to, a number of stability improvements, new plugins, interface changes, costmap filters.
See `Migration Guides <https://navigation.ros.org/migration/Foxy.html>`_ for full list

tf2_ros Python split out of tf2_ros
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Python code that used to live in tf2_ros has been moved into its own package named tf2_ros_py.
Any existing Python code that depends on tf2_ros will continue to work, but the package.xml of those packages should be amended to ``exec_depend`` on tf2_ros_py.

tf2_ros Python TransformListener uses global namespace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Python ``TransformListener`` now subscribes to ``/tf`` and ``/tf_static`` in the global namespace.
Previously, it was susbcribing in the node's namespace.
This means that the node's namespace will no longer have an effect on the ``/tf`` and ``/tf_static`` subscriptions.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo --ros-args -r __ns:=/test -- odom base_link

will subscribe to ``/tf`` and ``/tf_static``, as ``ros2 topic list`` will show.

rclcpp
^^^^^^

Change in spin_until_future_complete template parameters
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The first template parameter of ``Executor::spin_until_future_complete`` was the future result type ``ResultT``, and the method only accepted a ``std::shared_future<ResultT>``.
In order to accept other types of futures (e.g.: ``std::future``), that parameter was changed to the future type itself.

In places where a ``spin_until_future_complete`` call was relying on template argument deduction, no change is needed.
If not, this is an example diff:

.. code-block:: dpatch

   std::shared_future<MyResultT> future;
   ...
   -executor.spin_until_future_complete<MyResultT>(future);
   +executor.spin_until_future_complete<std::shared_future<MyResultT>>(future);


For more details, see `ros2/rclcpp#1160 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1160>`_.
For an example of the needed changes in user code, see `ros-visualization/interactive_markers#72 <https://github.com/ros-visualization/interactive_markers/pull/72>`_.

Change in default ``/clock`` subscription QoS profile
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The default was changed from a reliable communication with history depth 10 to a best effort communication with history depth 1.
See `ros2/rclcpp#1312 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1312>`_.

Waitable API
""""""""""""

Waitable API was modified to avoid issues with the ``MultiThreadedExecutor``.
This only affects users implementing a custom waitable.
See `ros2/rclcpp#1241 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1241>`_ for more details.

Change in ``rclcpp``'s logging macros
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Previously, the logging macros were vulnerable to a `format string attack <https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Format_string_attack>`_, where the format string is evaluated and can potentially execute code, read the stack, or cause a segmentation fault in the running program.
To address this security issue, the logging macro now accepts only string literals for it's format string argument.

If you previously had code like:

.. code-block::

  const char *my_const_char_string format = "Foo";
  RCLCPP_DEBUG(get_logger(), my_const_char_string);

you should now replace it with:

.. code-block::

  const char *my_const_char_string format = "Foo";
  RCLCPP_DEBUG(get_logger(), "%s", my_const_char_string);

or:

.. code-block::

  RCLCPP_DEBUG(get_logger(), "Foo");


This change removes some convenience from the logging macros, as ``std::string``\s are no longer accepted as the format argument.


If you previously had code with no format arguments like:

.. code-block::

  std::string my_std_string = "Foo";
  RCLCPP_DEBUG(get_logger(), my_std_string);

you should now replace it with:

.. code-block::

    std::string my_std_string = "Foo";
    RCLCPP_DEBUG(get_logger(), "%s", my_std_string.c_str());

.. note::
    If you are using a ``std::string`` as a format string with format arguments, converting that string to a ``char *`` and using it as the format string will yield a format security warning. That's because the compiler has no way at compile to introspect into the ``std::string`` to verify the arguments.  To avoid the security warning, we recommend you build the string manually and pass it in with no format arguments like the previous example.

``std::stringstream`` types are still accepted as arguments to the stream logging macros.
See `ros2/rclcpp#1442 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1442>`_ for more details.

Parameter types are now static by default
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Previously, the type of a parameter could be changed when a parameter was set.
For example, if a parameter was declared as an integer, a later call to set the parameter could change that type to a string.
This behavior could lead to bugs, and is rarely what the user wants.
As of Galactic parameter types are static by default, and attempts to change the type will fail.
If the previous dynamic behavior is desired, there is an mechanism to opt it in (see the code below).

rclpy
^^^^^

Removal of deprecated Node.set_parameters_callback
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The method ``Node.set_parameters_callback`` was `deprecated in ROS Foxy <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/pull/504>`_ and has been `removed in ROS Galactic <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/pull/633>`_.
Use ``Node.add_on_set_parameters_callback()`` instead.
Here is some example code using it.

.. code-block:: python

    import rclpy
    import rclpy.node
    from rcl_interfaces.msg import ParameterType
    from rcl_interfaces.msg import SetParametersResult


    rclpy.init()
    node = rclpy.node.Node('callback_example')
    node.declare_parameter('my_param', 'initial value')


    def on_parameter_event(parameter_list):
        for parameter in parameter_list:
            node.get_logger().info(f'Got {parameter.name}={parameter.value}')
        return SetParametersResult(successful=True)


    node.add_on_set_parameters_callback(on_parameter_event)
    rclpy.spin(node)

Run this command to see the parameter callback in action.

.. code-block::

    ros2 param set /callback_example my_param "Hello World"

Parameter types are now static by default
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In Foxy and earlier a call to set a parameter could change its type.
As of Galactic parameter types are static and cannot be changed by default.
If the previous behavior is desired, then set ``dynamic_typing`` to true in the parameter descriptor.
Here is an example.

.. code-block:: python

  import rclpy
  import rclpy.node
  from rcl_interfaces.msg import ParameterDescriptor

  rclpy.init()
  node = rclpy.node.Node('static_param_example')
  node.declare_parameter('static_param', 'initial value')
  node.declare_parameter('dynamic_param', 'initial value', descriptor=ParameterDescriptor(dynamic_typing=True))
  rclpy.spin(node)

Run these commands to see how statically and dynamically typed parameters are different.

.. code-block:: console

    $ ros2 param set /static_param_example dynamic_param 42
    Set parameter successful
    $ ros2 param set /static_param_example static_param 42
    Setting parameter failed: Wrong parameter type, expected 'Type.STRING' got 'Type.INTEGER'

New API for checking QoS profile compatibility
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``rclpy.qos.qos_check_compatible`` is `a new function <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/pull/708>`_ for checking the compatibility of two QoS profiles.
If the profiles are compatible, then a publisher and subscriber using them will be able to talk to each other.

.. code-block:: python

    import rclpy.qos

    publisher_profile = rclpy.qos.qos_profile_sensor_data
    subscription_profile = rclpy.qos.qos_profile_parameter_events

    print(rclpy.qos.qos_check_compatible(publisher_profile, subscription_profile))

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 qos_check_compatible_example.py
    (QoSCompatibility.ERROR, 'ERROR: Best effort publisher and reliable subscription;')

rclcpp_action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Action client goal response callback signature changed
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The goal response callback should now take a shared pointer to a goal handle, instead of a future.

For `example <https://github.com/ros2/examples/pull/291>`_, old signature:

.. code-block:: c++

   void goal_response_callback(std::shared_future<GoalHandleFibonacci::SharedPtr> future)

New signature:

.. code-block:: c++

   void goal_response_callback(GoalHandleFibonacci::SharedPtr goal_handle)

rosidl_typesupport_introspection_c
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

API break in function that gets an element from an array
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The signature of the function was changed because it was semantically different to all the other functions used to get an element from an array or sequence.
This only affects authors of rmw implementations using the introspection typesupport.

For further details, see `ros2/rosidl#531 <https://github.com/ros2/rosidl/pull/531>`_.

rcl_lifecycle and rclcpp_lifecycle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

RCL's lifecycle state machine gets new init API
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The lifecycle state machine in rcl_lifecycle was modified to expect a newly introduced options struct, combining general configurations for the state machine.
The option struct allows to indicate whether the state machine shall be initialized with default values, whether its attached services are active and which allocator to be used.

.. code-block:: c

  rcl_ret_t
  rcl_lifecycle_state_machine_init(
    rcl_lifecycle_state_machine_t * state_machine,
    rcl_node_t * node_handle,
    const rosidl_message_type_support_t * ts_pub_notify,
    const rosidl_service_type_support_t * ts_srv_change_state,
    const rosidl_service_type_support_t * ts_srv_get_state,
    const rosidl_service_type_support_t * ts_srv_get_available_states,
    const rosidl_service_type_support_t * ts_srv_get_available_transitions,
    const rosidl_service_type_support_t * ts_srv_get_transition_graph,
    const rcl_lifecycle_state_machine_options_t * state_machine_options);

RCL's lifecycle state machine stores allocator instance
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The options struct (discussed above) entails an instance of the allocator being used for initializing the state machine.
This options struct and there the embodied allocator are being stored within the lifecycle state machine.
As a direct consequence, the ``rcl_lifecycle_fini function`` no longer expects an allocator in its fini function but rather uses the allocator set in the options struct for deallocating its internal data structures.

.. code-block:: c

  rcl_ret_t
  rcl_lifecycle_state_machine_fini(
    rcl_lifecycle_state_machine_t * state_machine,
    rcl_node_t * node_handle);

RCLCPP's lifecycle node exposes option to not instantiate services
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In order to use rclcpp's lifecycle nodes without exposing its internal services such as ``change_state``, ``get_state`` et. al., the constructor of a lifecycle node has a newly introduced parameter indicating whether or not the services shall be available.
This boolean flag is set to true by default, not requiring any changes to existing API if not wished.

.. code-block:: c++

  explicit LifecycleNode(
    const std::string & node_name,
    const rclcpp::NodeOptions & options = rclcpp::NodeOptions(),
    bool enable_communication_interface = true);

Known Issues
------------

ros2cli
^^^^^^^

Daemon slows down CLI on Windows
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

As a workaround, CLI commands may be used without a daemon e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

  ros2 topic list --no-daemon


Issue is tracked by `ros2/ros2cli#637 <https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/637>`_.

rqt
^^^

Some rqt_bag icons are missing
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The icons to "Zoom In", "Zoom Out", "Zoom Home", and "Toggle Thumbnails" are missing in ``rqt_bag``.
The issue is tracked in `ros-visualization/rqt_bag#102 <https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_bag/issues/102>`_

Most rqt utilities don't work standalone on Windows
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Launching the rqt utilities "standalone" on Windows (like ``ros2 run rqt_graph rqt_graph``) generally doesn't work.
The workaround is to launch the rqt container process (``rqt``), and then insert the plugins to be used.

rviz2
^^^^^

RViz2 panel close buttons are blank
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The upper right-hand corner of every RViz2 panel should contain an "X" to allow one to close the panel.
Those buttons are there, but the "X" inside of them is missing on all platforms.
The issue is being tracked in `ros2/rviz2#692 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/692>`__.
