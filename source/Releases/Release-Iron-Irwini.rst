New features in this ROS 2 release
----------------------------------

ros2topic
^^^^^^^^^

``now`` as keyword for ``builtin_interfaces.msg.Time`` and ``auto`` for ``std_msgs.msg.Header``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
``ros2 topic pub`` now allows to set a ``builtin_interfaces.msg.Time`` message to the current time via the ``now`` keyword.
Similarly, a ``std_msg.msg.Header`` message will be automatically generated when passed the keyword ``auto``.
This behavior matches that of ROS 1's ``rostopic`` (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/YAMLCommandLine#Headers.2Ftimestamps)

Changes since the Humble release
----------------------------------

``launch_ros``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Renamed classes which used ``Ros`` in the name to use ``ROS`` in line with PEP8
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The classes affected include:

* ``launch.actions.RosTimer`` -> ``launch.actions.ROSTimer``
* ``launch.actions.PushRosNamespace`` -> ``launch.actions.PushROSNamespace``

The old class names are still there, but will be deprecated.
