New features in this ROS 2 release
----------------------------------

ros2topic
^^^^^^^^^

``now`` as keyword for ``builtin_interfaces.msg.Time`` and ``auto`` for ``std_msgs.msg.Header``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
``ros2 topic pub`` now allows to set a ``builtin_interfaces.msg.Time`` message to the current time via the ``now`` keyword.
Similarly, a ``std_msg.msg.Header`` message will be automatically generated when passed the keyword ``auto``.
This behavior matches that of ROS 1's ``rostopic`` (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/YAMLCommandLine#Headers.2Ftimestamps)

Changes since the Humble release
----------------------------------

``launch_ros``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Renamed classes which used ``Ros`` in the name to use ``ROS`` in line with PEP8
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Classes that were changed:

* ``launch.actions.RosTimer`` -> ``launch.actions.ROSTimer``
* ``launch.actions.PushRosNamespace`` -> ``launch.actions.PushROSNamespace``

The old class names are still there, but will be deprecated.

Change to the default console logging file flushing behavior
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This specifically applies to the default ``spdlog`` based logging backend in ROS 2, implemented in ``rcl_logging_spdlog``.
Log file flushing was changed to flush every time an "error" log message is used, e.g. each ``RCLCPP_ERROR()`` call, and also periodically every five seconds.

Previously, ``spdlog`` was used without configuring anything other than creating the sink for logging to a file.

We tested the change and did not find that the CPU overhead was significant, even on machines with slow disks (e.g. sd cards).
However, if this change is causing you problems, you can get the old behavior by setting the ``RCL_LOGGING_SPDLOG_EXPERIMENTAL_OLD_FLUSHING_BEHAVIOR=1`` environment variable.

Later we would like to have support for a full configuration file (see: https://github.com/ros2/rcl_logging/issues/92), giving you more flexibility in how the logging is done, but that is work that is only planned right now.

  Therefore, **this environment variable should be considered experimental and subject to removal without deprecation in the future**, when we add config file support for the ``rcl_logging_spdlog`` logging backend.

See this pull request for more details about the change: https://github.com/ros2/rcl_logging/pull/95
