*Jazzy Jalisco* is the tenth release of ROS 2.
What follows is highlights of the important changes and features in Jazzy Jalisco since the last release.
For a list of all of the changes since Iron, see the :doc:`long form changelog <Jazzy-Jalisco-Complete-Changelog>`

Supported Platforms
-------------------

Jazzy Jalisco is primarily supported on the following platforms:

Tier 1 platforms:

* Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble): ``amd64`` and ``arm64``
* Windows 10 (Visual Studio 2019): ``amd64``

Tier 2 platforms:

* RHEL 9: ``amd64``

Tier 3 platforms:

* macOS: ``amd64``
* Debian Bookworm: ``amd64``

For more information about RMW implementations, compiler / interpreter versions, and system dependency versions see `REP 2000 <https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html>`__.

Installation
------------

`Install Jazzy Jalisco <../../jazzy/Installation.html>`__

Changes to how ROS 2 and Gazebo integrate
-----------------------------------------

Starting with Jazzy Jalisco, we are streamlining how ROS 2 and `Gazebo <https://gazebosim.org>`__ integrate.
For every ROS 2 release, there will be a recommended, supported Gazebo release that goes along with that release.
For Jazzy Jalisco, the recommended Gazebo release will be Harmonic.

To make it easier for ROS 2 packages to consume Gazebo packages, there are now ``gz_*_vendor`` packages.
Those packages are:

* gz_common_vendor: https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_common_vendor
* gz_cmake_vendor: https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_cmake_vendor
* gz_math_vendor: https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_math_vendor
* gz_transport_vendor: https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_transport_vendor
* gz_sensor_vendor: https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_sensor_vendor
* gz_sim_vendor: https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_sim_vendor
* gz_tools_vendor: https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_tools_vendor
* gz_utils_vendor: https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_utils_vendor
* sdformat_vendor: https://github.com/gazebo-release/sdformat_vendor

ROS 2 packages can use the functionality in these packages by adding dependencies in ``package.xml``, e.g.:

.. code::

   <depend>gz_math_vendor</depend>

And then using them in ``CMakeLists.txt``, e.g.:

.. code::

   find_package(gz_math_vendor REQUIRED)
   find_package(gz-math)

   add_executable(my_executable src/exe.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(my_executable gz-math::core)

.. note::

   It will still be possible to use alternate Gazebo versions with Jazzy Jalisco.  But those will not be as well tested or integrated with ROS 2.  See https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/ros_installation for more information.

Included new API to lookup the velocity of the moving frame in the reference frame.

See https://github.com/ros2/geometry2/pull/646 for more information.

``rcl``
^^^^^^^

Actual and expected call time when timer is called
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

New timer API ``rcl_timer_call_with_info`` is added to collect actual and expected call time when the timer is called.
This allows users to get the timer information when the timer is expected to be called and actual time that timer is called.

See https://github.com/ros2/rcl/pull/1113 for more details.

Improved rcl_wait in the area of timeout computation and spurious wakeups
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Added special handling for timers with a clock that has time override enabled.
For these timer we should not compute a timeout, as the waitset is woken up by the associated guard condition.

See https://github.com/ros2/rcl/issues/1146 for more details.

``rclcpp``
^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed data race conditions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Fixed data race conditions in executors.

See https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/2500 for more details.

Utilize ``rclcpp::WaitSet`` as part of the executors
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Improve the number of ``rcl_wait_set`` creations and deletions by making the default Single/Multithreaded executors work like the static single threaded executor
in terms of entity collection rebuilding.

See https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/2142 for more details.

``rclcpp::get_typesupport_handle`` is deprecated
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``rclcpp::get_typesupport_handle`` that extracts message type support handle is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release.
Instead, ``rclcpp::get_message_typesupport_handle`` should be used.

See https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/2209 for more details.

Deprecated ``rclcpp/qos_event.hpp`` header was removed
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In Iron, the header ``rclcpp/qos_event.hpp`` was deprecated in favor of ``rclcpp/event_handler.hpp``.
In Jazzy, the ``rclcpp/qos_event.hpp`` header has been completely removed.

Deprecated subscription callback signatures were removed
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Back in Humble, subscription signatures of the form ``void callback(std::shared_ptr<MessageT>)`` and ``void callback(std::shared_ptr<MessageT>, const rclcpp::MessageInfo &)`` were deprecated.

In Jazzy, these subscription signatures have been removed.
Users should switch to using ``void callback(std::shared_ptr<const MessageT>)`` or ``void callback(std::shared_ptr<const MessageT>, const rclcpp MessageInfo &)``.

Actual and expected call time when timer is called
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``rclcpp::TimerInfo`` argument is added to the timer callback to collect actual and expected call time when the timer is called.
This allows https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/2343 users to get the timer information when the timer is expected to be called and actual time that timer is called.

See https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/2343 for more details.

``rclcpp_action``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Callback after cancel
"""""""""""""""""""""

Added a function to stop callbacks of a goal handle after it has gone out of scope.
