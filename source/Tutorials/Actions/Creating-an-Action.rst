Background
----------

You learned about actions previously in the :doc:`../Understanding-ROS2-Actions` tutorial.
Like the other communication types and their respective interfaces (topics/msg and services/srv),
you can also custom-define actions in your packages.
This tutorial shows you how to define and build an action that you can use
with the action server and action client you will write in the next tutorial.

Prerequisites
-------------

You should have :doc:`ROS 2 (Dashing or later)<../../Installation>` and
`colcon <https://colcon.readthedocs.org>`__ installed.

Set up a :doc:`workspace <../Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace>` and create a package named ``action_tutorials_interfaces``:

(Remember to :doc:`source your ROS 2 installation <../Configuring-ROS2-Environment>` first.)

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: bash

      mkdir -p action_ws/src
      cd action_ws/src
      ros2 pkg create action_tutorials_interfaces

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: bash

      mkdir -p action_ws/src
      cd action_ws/src
      ros2 pkg create action_tutorials_interfaces

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: bash

      md action_ws\src
      cd action_ws\src
      ros2 pkg create action_tutorials_interfaces

Tasks
-----

1 Defining an action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Actions are defined in ``.action`` files of the form:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Request
    ---
    # Result
    ---
    # Feedback

An action definition is made up of three message definitions separated by ``---``.

- A *request* message is sent from an action client to an action server initiating a new goal.
- A *result* message is sent from an action server to an action client when a goal is done.
- *Feedback* messages are periodically sent from an action server to an action client with updates about a goal.

An instance of an action is typically referred to as a *goal*.

Say we want to define a new action "Fibonacci" for computing the `Fibonacci sequence <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number>`__.

Create an ``action`` directory in our ROS 2 package ``action_tutorials_interfaces``:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: bash

      cd action_tutorials_interfaces
      mkdir action

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: bash

      cd action_tutorials_interfaces
      mkdir action

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: bash

      cd action_tutorials_interfaces
      md action

Within the ``action`` directory, create a file called ``Fibonacci.action`` with the following contents:

.. code-block:: console

  int32 order
  ---
  int32[] sequence
  ---
  int32[] partial_sequence

The goal request is the ``order`` of the Fibonacci sequence we want to compute, the result is the final ``sequence``, and the feedback is the ``partial_sequence`` computed so far.

2 Building an action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before we can use the new Fibonacci action type in our code, we must pass the definition to the rosidl code generation pipeline.

This is accomplished by adding the following lines to our ``CMakeLists.txt`` before the ``ament_package()`` line, in the ``action_tutorials_interfaces``:

.. code-block:: cmake

    find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)

    rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
      "action/Fibonacci.action"
    )

We should also add the required dependencies to our ``package.xml``:

.. code-block:: xml

    <buildtool_depend>rosidl_default_generators</buildtool_depend>

    <depend>action_msgs</depend>

    <member_of_group>rosidl_interface_packages</member_of_group>

Note, we need to depend on ``action_msgs`` since action definitions include additional metadata (e.g. goal IDs).

We should now be able to build the package containing the ``Fibonacci`` action definition:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Change to the root of the workspace
    cd ~/action_ws
    # Build
    colcon build

We're done!

By convention, action types will be prefixed by their package name and the word ``action``.
So when we want to refer to our new action, it will have the full name ``action_tutorials_interfaces/action/Fibonacci``.

We can check that our action built successfully with the command line tool:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Source our workspace
   # On Windows: call install/setup.bat
   . install/setup.bash
   # Check that our action definition exists
   ros2 interface show action_tutorials_interfaces/action/Fibonacci

You should see the Fibonacci action definition printed to the screen.

Summary
-------

In this tutorial, you learned the structure of an action definition.
You also learned how to correctly build a new action interface using ``CMakeLists.txt`` and ``package.xml``,
and how to verify a successful build.

Next steps
----------

Next, let's utilize your newly defined action interface by creating an action service and client (in :doc:`Python <./Writing-a-Py-Action-Server-Client>` or :doc:`C++ <./Writing-a-Cpp-Action-Server-Client>`).
