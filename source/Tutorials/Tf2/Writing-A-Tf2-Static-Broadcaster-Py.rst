Background
----------

In this tutorial we will write code to publish static transforms to tf2.
This is a standalone tutorial covering the basics of static transforms.

In the next two tutorials we will write the code to reproduce the demo
from the :ref:`Introduction to tf2 <IntroToTf2>` tutorial. After that,
the following tutorials focus on extending the demo with more advanced tf2 features.

Prerequisites
-------------

In previous tutorials, you learned how to :ref:`create a workspace <ROS2Workspace>`
and :ref:`create a package <CreatePkg>`.

Tasks
-----

1 Create a package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First we will create a package that will be used for this tutorial
and the following ones. The package called ``learning_tf2_py`` will depend on
``rclpy``, ``tf2_ros``, ``geometry_msgs``, and ``turtlesim``. Code for this tutorial is stored
`here <https://github.com/ros/geometry_tutorials/blob/ros2/turtle_tf2_py/turtle_tf2_py/static_turtle_tf2_broadcaster.py>`_.

Open a new terminal and :ref:`source your ROS 2 installation <ConfigROS2>` so that ``ros2`` commands will work.
Navigate to workspace's ``src`` folder and create a new package:

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python learning_tf2_py

Your terminal will return a message verifying the creation of your package ``learning_tf2_py``
and all its necessary files and folders.

2 Write the static broadcaster node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's first create the source files.
Inside the ``src/learning_tf2_py/learning_tf2_py`` directory, create a new file called
``static_turtle_tf2_broadcaster.py`` and paste the following code within:

.. code-block:: python

   import sys

   from geometry_msgs.msg import TransformStamped

   import rclpy
   from rclpy.node import Node

   from tf2_ros.static_transform_broadcaster import StaticTransformBroadcaster

   import tf_transformations


   class StaticFramePublisher(Node):
      """
      Broadcast transforms that never change.

      This example publishes transforms from `world` to a static turtle frame.
      The transforms are only published once at startup, and are constant for all
      time.
      """

      def __init__(self, transformation):
         super().__init__('static_turtle_tf2_broadcaster')

         self._tf_publisher = StaticTransformBroadcaster(self)

         # Publish static transforms once at startup
         self._tf_publisher.sendTransform(self.make_transforms(transformation))

      def make_transforms(self, transformation):
         static_transformStamped = TransformStamped()
         static_transformStamped.header.stamp = self.get_clock().now().to_msg()
         static_transformStamped.header.frame_id = 'world'
         static_transformStamped.child_frame_id = sys.argv[1]
         static_transformStamped.transform.translation.x = float(sys.argv[2])
         static_transformStamped.transform.translation.y = float(sys.argv[3])
         static_transformStamped.transform.translation.z = float(sys.argv[4])
         quat = tf_transformations.quaternion_from_euler(
               float(sys.argv[5]), float(sys.argv[6]), float(sys.argv[7]))
         static_transformStamped.transform.rotation.x = quat[0]
         static_transformStamped.transform.rotation.y = quat[1]
         static_transformStamped.transform.rotation.z = quat[2]
         static_transformStamped.transform.rotation.w = quat[3]

         return (static_transformStamped)


   def main():
      logger = rclpy.logging.get_logger('logger')

      # obtain parameters from command line arguments
      if len(sys.argv) < 8:
         logger.info('Invalid number of parameters. Usage: \n'
                     '$ ros2 run learning_tf2_py static_turtle_tf2_broadcaster'
                     'child_frame_name x y z roll pitch yaw')
         sys.exit(0)
      else:
         if sys.argv[1] == 'world':
               logger.info('Your static turtle name cannot be "world"')
               sys.exit(0)

      # pass parameters and initialize node
      rclpy.init()
      node = StaticFramePublisher(sys.argv)
      try:
         rclpy.spin(node)
      except KeyboardInterrupt:
         pass

      rclpy.shutdown()

2.1 Examine the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now let's look at the code that is relevant to publishing the static turtle pose to tf2.
The first lines import required packages.`
First we import the ``TransformStamped`` from the ``geometry_msgs``,
that provides us a template for the message that we will
publish to the transformation tree.

.. code-block:: python

   from geometry_msgs.msg import TransformStamped

Afterward, ``rclpy`` is imported so its ``Node`` class can be used.

.. code-block:: python

   import rclpy
   from rclpy.node import Node

The ``tf2_ros`` package provides a ``StaticTransformBroadcaster`` to make the publishing of
static transforms easy. To use the ``StaticTransformBroadcaster``, we need to import it from the
``tf2_ros`` module. ``tf_transformations`` provides functions to convert euler angles to quaternions
and vice versa.

.. code-block:: python

   from tf2_ros.static_transform_broadcaster import StaticTransformBroadcaster

   import tf_transformations

The ``StaticFramePublisher`` class constructor initializes the node with the name
``static_turtle_tf2_broadcaster``. Then, ``StaticTransformBroadcaster``
is created that will send one static transformation upon the startup.

.. code-block:: python

   self._tf_publisher = StaticTransformBroadcaster(self)
   self._tf_publisher.sendTransform(self.make_transforms(transformation))

Here we create a ``TransformStamped`` object which will be the message we will send over once
populated. Before passing the actual transform values we need to give it the appropriate metadata.

#. We need to give the transform being published a timestamp and we'll just stamp it with the current time, ``get_clock().now()``

#. Then we need to set the name of the parent frame of the link we're creating, in this case ``world``

#. Finally, we need to set the name of the child frame of the link we're creating

.. code-block:: python

   static_transformStamped = TransformStamped()
   static_transformStamped.header.stamp = self.get_clock().now().to_msg()
   static_transformStamped.header.frame_id = 'world'
   static_transformStamped.child_frame_id = sys.argv[1]

Here we populate the 6D pose (translation and rotation) of the turtle.

.. code-block:: python

   static_transformStamped.transform.translation.x = float(sys.argv[2])
   static_transformStamped.transform.translation.y = float(sys.argv[3])
   static_transformStamped.transform.translation.z = float(sys.argv[4])
   quat = tf_transformations.quaternion_from_euler(
      float(sys.argv[5]), float(sys.argv[6]), float(sys.argv[7]))
   static_transformStamped.transform.rotation.x = quat[0]
   static_transformStamped.transform.rotation.y = quat[1]
   static_transformStamped.transform.rotation.z = quat[2]
   static_transformStamped.transform.rotation.w = quat[3]

Finally we broadcast static transform using the ``sendTransform()`` function.

.. code-block:: python

   broadcaster.sendTransform(static_transformStamped)

2.2 Add dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Navigate one level back to the ``src/learning_tf2_py`` directory, where the ``setup.py``, ``setup.cfg``, and ``package.xml`` files have been created for you.

Open ``package.xml`` with your text editor.

As mentioned in the :ref:`Creating your first ROS 2 package tutorial <CreatePkg>`, make sure to fill in the ``<description>``, ``<maintainer>`` and ``<license>`` tags:

.. code-block:: xml

  <description>Examples of minimal publisher/subscriber using rclpy</description>
  <maintainer email="you@email.com">Your Name</maintainer>
  <license>Apache License 2.0</license>

After the lines above, add the following dependencies corresponding to your nodeâ€™s import statements:

.. code-block:: xml

   <exec_depend>geometry_msgs</exec_depend>
   <exec_depend>rclpy</exec_depend>
   <exec_depend>tf_transformations</exec_depend>
   <exec_depend>tf2_ros</exec_depend>
   <exec_depend>turtlesim</exec_depend>

This declares the required ``geometry_msgs``, ``tf_transformations``, ``rclpy``, ``tf2_ros``, and ``turtlesim`` dependencies when its code is executed.

Make sure to save the file.

2.3 Add an entry point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To allow the ``ros2 run`` command to run your node, you must add the entry point
to ``setup.py`` (located in the ``src/learning_tf2_py`` directory).

Add the following line between the ``'console_scripts':`` brackets:

.. code-block:: python

   'static_turtle_tf2_broadcaster = learning_tf2_py.static_turtle_tf2_broadcaster:main',

3 Build and run
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's good practice to run ``rosdep`` in the root of your workspace to
check for missing dependencies before building:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      .. code-block:: console

        rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro rolling -y

   .. group-tab:: macOS

      rosdep only runs on Linux, so you can skip ahead to next step.

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      rosdep only runs on Linux, so you can skip ahead to next step.


Still in the root of your workspace, build your new package:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      colcon build --packages-select learning_tf2_py

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      colcon build --packages-select learning_tf2_py

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

      colcon build --merge-install --packages-select learning_tf2_py

Open a new terminal, navigate to the root of your workspace, and source the setup files:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      . install/setup.bash

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      . install/setup.bash

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

      call install/setup.bat

Now run the ``static_turtle_tf2_broadcaster`` node:

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 run learning_tf2_py static_turtle_tf2_broadcaster mystaticturtle 0 0 1 0 0 0

This sets a turtle pose broadcast for ``mystaticturtle`` to float 1 meter above the ground.

We can now check that the static transform has been published by echoing the ``tf_static`` topic

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 topic echo /tf_static

If everything went well you should see a single static transform

.. code-block:: console

   transforms:
   - header:
      stamp:
         sec: 1622908754
         nanosec: 208515730
      frame_id: world
   child_frame_id: mystaticturtle
   transform:
      translation:
         x: 0.0
         y: 0.0
         z: 1.0
      rotation:
         x: 0.0
         y: 0.0
         z: 0.0
         w: 1.0

The proper way to publish static transforms
-------------------------------------------

This tutorial aimed to show how ``StaticTransformBroadcaster`` can be used to publish static
transforms. In your real development process you shouldn't have to write this code yourself
and should privilege the use of the dedicated ``tf2_ros`` tool to do so. ``tf2_ros`` provides an
executable named ``static_transform_publisher`` that can be used either as a commandline tool
or a node that you can add to your launchfiles.

Publish a static coordinate transform to tf2 using an x/y/z offset in meters and
yaw/pitch/roll in radians. (yaw is rotation about Z, pitch is rotation about Y,
and roll is rotation about X).

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher x y z yaw pitch roll frame_id child_frame_id

Publish a static coordinate transform to tf2 using an x/y/z offset in meters and quaternion.

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher x y z qx qy qz qw frame_id child_frame_id

``static_transform_publisher`` is designed both as a command-line tool for manual use, as well as
for use within ``launch`` files for setting static transforms. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   from launch import LaunchDescription
   from launch_ros.actions import Node

   def generate_launch_description():
      return LaunchDescription([
         Node(
               package='tf2_ros',
               executable='static_transform_publisher',
               arguments = ['0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', 'world', 'mystaticturtle']
         ),
      ])
