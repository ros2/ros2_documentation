Introduction to tf2
===================

**Goal:** Run a turtlesim demo and see some of the power of tf2 in a multi-robot example using turtlesim.

**Tutorial level:** Intermediate

**Time:** 10 minutes

Installing the Demo
-------------------

Let's start by installing the demo package and its dependencies.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Linux Binaries

      .. code-block:: console

         sudo apt-get install ros-rolling-turtle-tf2-py ros-rolling-tf2-tools

   .. group-tab:: From Source

      .. code-block:: console

         # Clone and build the geometry_tutorials repo using the branch that matches your installation
         git clone https://github.com/ros/geometry_tutorials.git -b ros2

Additionally, install a ``transforms3d`` package, which provides the quaternion and euler angle transformation functionality.

.. code-block:: console

   pip3 install transforms3d

Running the Demo
----------------

Now that we've installed the ``turtle_tf2_py`` tutorial package let's run the demo.
First, open a new terminal and :ref:`source your ROS 2 installation <ConfigROS2>` so that ``ros2`` commands will work.
Then run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 launch turtle_tf2_py turtle_tf2_demo.launch.py

You will see the turtlesim start with two turtles.

.. image:: turtlesim_follow1.png

In the second terminal window type the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

Once the turtlesim is started you can drive the central turtle around in the turtlesim using the keyboard arrow keys,
select the second terminal window so that your keystrokes will be captured to drive the turtle.

.. image:: turtlesim_follow2.png

You can see that one turtle continuously moves to follow the turtle you are driving around.

What is Happening
-----------------

This demo is using the tf2 library to create three coordinate frames: a ``world`` frame, a ``turtle1`` frame, and a ``turtle2`` frame.
This tutorial uses a tf2 broadcaster to publish the turtle coordinate frames and a tf2 listener to compute the difference in the turtle frames and move one turtle to follow the other.

tf2 Tools
---------

Now let's look at how tf2 is being used to create this demo.
We can use ``tf2_tools`` to look at what tf2 is doing behind the scenes.

1 Using view_frames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``view_frames`` creates a diagram of the frames being broadcasted by tf2 over ROS.

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames

You will see:

.. code-block:: console

   Listening to tf data during 5 seconds...
   Generating graph in frames.pdf file...

Here a tf2 listener is listening to the frames that are being broadcasted over ROS and drawing a tree of how the frames are connected.
To view the tree, open the resulting ``frames.pdf`` with your favorite PDF viewer.

.. image:: turtlesim_frames.png

Here we can see three frames that are broadcasted by tf2: ``world``, ``turtle1``, and ``turtle2``.
The ``world`` here is the parent of the ``turtle1`` and ``turtle2`` frames.
``view_frames`` also report some diagnostic information about when the oldest and most
recent frame transforms were received and how fast the tf2 frame is published to tf2 for debugging purposes.

2 Using tf2_echo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``tf2_echo`` reports the transform between any two frames broadcasted over ROS.

Usage:

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo [reference_frame] [target_frame]

Let's look at the transform of the ``turtle2`` frame with respect to ``turtle1`` frame which is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo turtle2 turtle1

You will see the transform displayed as the ``tf2_echo`` listener receives the frames broadcasted over ROS2.

.. code-block:: console

   At time 1622031731.625364060
   - Translation: [2.796, 1.039, 0.000]
   - Rotation: in Quaternion [0.000, 0.000, 0.202, 0.979]
   At time 1622031732.614745114
   - Translation: [1.608, 0.250, 0.000]
   - Rotation: in Quaternion [0.000, 0.000, 0.032, 0.999]

As you drive your turtle around you will see the transform change as the two turtles move relative to each other.

rviz and tf2
------------

``rviz`` is a visualization tool that is useful for examining tf2 frames.
Let's look at our turtle frames using rviz.
Let's start rviz with the ``turtle_rviz.rviz`` configuration file using the ``-d`` option:

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 run rviz2 rviz2 -d $(ros2 pkg prefix --share turtle_tf2_py)/rviz/turtle_rviz.rviz

.. image:: turtlesim_rviz.png

In the side bar you will see the frames broadcasted by tf2. As you drive the turtle around you will see the frames move in rviz.
