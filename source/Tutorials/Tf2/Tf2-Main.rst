tf2 Tutorials
=============

Many of the tf2 tutorials are available for both C++ and Python.
The tutorials are streamlined to complete either the C++ track or the Python track.
If you want to learn both C++ and Python, you should go through the tutorials
once for C++ and once for Python.

Learning tf2
------------

#. :ref:`Introduction to tf2 <IntroToTf2>`.

   This tutorial will give you a good idea of what tf2 can do for you. It
   shows off some of the tf2 power in a multi-robot example using turtlesim.
   This also introduces using ``tf2_echo``, ``view_frames``, and ``rviz``.

#. Writing a tf2 static broadcaster :ref:`(Python) <WritingATf2StaticBroadcasterPy>` :ref:`(C++) <WritingATf2StaticBroadcasterCpp>`.

   This tutorial teaches you how to broadcast static coordinate frames to tf2.

#. Writing a tf2 broadcaster :ref:`(Python) <WritingATf2BroadcasterPy>` :ref:`(C++) <WritingATf2BroadcasterCpp>`.

   This tutorial teaches you how to broadcast the state of a robot to tf2.

#. Writing a tf2 listener :ref:`(Python) <WritingATf2ListenerPy>` :ref:`(C++) <WritingATf2ListenerCpp>`.

   This tutorial teaches you how to use tf2 to get access to frame transformations.

#. Adding a frame :ref:`(Python) <AddingAFramePy>`.

   This tutorial teaches you how to add an extra fixed frame to tf2.

#. Learning about tf2 and time :ref:`(Python) <LearningAboutTf2AndTimePy>`.

   This tutorial teaches you to use the timeout in ``lookup_transform`` function to
   wait for a transform to be available on the tf2 tree.

#. Time travel with tf2 :ref:`(Python) <TimeTravelWithTf2Py>` :ref:`(C++) <TimeTravelWithTf2Cpp>`.

   This tutorial teaches you about advanced time travel features of tf2.
