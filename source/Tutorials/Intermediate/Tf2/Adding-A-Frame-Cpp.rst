Background
----------

In previous tutorials, we recreated the turtle demo by writing a :doc:`tf2 broadcaster <./Writing-A-Tf2-Broadcaster-Cpp>` and a :doc:`tf2 listener <Writing-A-Tf2-Listener-Cpp>`.
This tutorial will teach you how to add extra fixed and dynamic frames to the transformation tree.
In fact, adding a frame in tf2 is very similar to creating the tf2 broadcaster, but this example will show you some additional features of tf2.

For many tasks related to transformations, it is easier to think inside a local frame.
For example, it is easiest to reason about laser scan measurements in a frame at the center of the laser scanner.
tf2 allows you to define a local frame for each sensor, link, or joint in your system.
When transforming from one frame to another, tf2 will take care of all the hidden intermediate frame transformations that are introduced.

tf2 tree
--------

tf2 builds up a tree structure of frames and, thus, does not allow a closed loop in the frame structure.
This means that a frame only has one single parent, but it can have multiple children.
Currently, our tf2 tree contains three frames: ``world``, ``turtle1`` and ``turtle2``.
The two turtle frames are children of the ``world`` frame.
If we want to add a new frame to tf2, one of the three existing frames needs to be the parent frame, and the new one will become its child frame.

Tasks
-----

1 Write the fixed frame broadcaster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In our turtle example, we'll add a new frame ``carrot1``, which will be the child of the ``turtle1``.
This frame will serve as the goal for the second turtle.

Let's first create the source files. Go to the ``learning_tf2_cpp`` package we created in the previous tutorials.
Download the fixed frame broadcaster code by entering the following command:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      .. code-block:: console

          wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/geometry_tutorials/ros2/turtle_tf2_cpp/src/fixed_frame_tf2_broadcaster.cpp

   .. group-tab:: macOS

      .. code-block:: console

          wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/geometry_tutorials/ros2/turtle_tf2_cpp/src/fixed_frame_tf2_broadcaster.cpp

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      In a Windows command line prompt:

      .. code-block:: console

          curl -sk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/geometry_tutorials/ros2/turtle_tf2_cpp/src/fixed_frame_tf2_broadcaster.cpp -o fixed_frame_tf2_broadcaster.cpp

      Or in powershell:

      .. code-block:: console

          curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/geometry_tutorials/ros2/turtle_tf2_cpp/src/fixed_frame_tf2_broadcaster.cpp -o fixed_frame_tf2_broadcaster.cpp

Now open the file called ``fixed_frame_tf2_broadcaster.cpp``.

.. code-block:: C++

    #include <chrono>
    #include <functional>
    #include <memory>

    #include "geometry_msgs/msg/transform_stamped.hpp"
    #include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"
    #include "tf2_ros/transform_broadcaster.h"

    using namespace std::chrono_literals;

    class FixedFrameBroadcaster : public rclcpp::Node
    {
    public:
      FixedFrameBroadcaster()
      : Node("fixed_frame_tf2_broadcaster")
      {
        tf_broadcaster_ = std::make_shared<tf2_ros::TransformBroadcaster>(this);
        timer_ = this->create_wall_timer(
          100ms, std::bind(&FixedFrameBroadcaster::broadcast_timer_callback, this));
      }

    private:
      void broadcast_timer_callback()
      {
        geometry_msgs::msg::TransformStamped t;

        t.header.stamp = this->get_clock()->now();
        t.header.frame_id = "turtle1";
        t.child_frame_id = "carrot1";
        t.transform.translation.x = 0.0;
        t.transform.translation.y = 2.0;
        t.transform.translation.z = 0.0;
        t.transform.rotation.x = 0.0;
        t.transform.rotation.y = 0.0;
        t.transform.rotation.z = 0.0;
        t.transform.rotation.w = 1.0;

        tf_broadcaster_->sendTransform(t);
      }

    rclcpp::TimerBase::SharedPtr timer_;
      std::shared_ptr<tf2_ros::TransformBroadcaster> tf_broadcaster_;
    };

    int main(int argc, char * argv[])
    {
      rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
      rclcpp::spin(std::make_shared<FixedFrameBroadcaster>());
      rclcpp::shutdown();
      return 0;
    }

The code is very similar to the tf2 broadcaster tutorial example and the only difference is that the transform here does not change over time.

1.1 Examine the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's take a look at the key lines in this piece of code.
Here we create a new transform, from the parent ``turtle1`` to the new child ``carrot1``.
The ``carrot1`` frame is 2 meters offset in y axis in terms of the ``turtle1`` frame.

.. code-block:: C++

    geometry_msgs::msg::TransformStamped t;

    t.header.stamp = this->get_clock()->now();
    t.header.frame_id = "turtle1";
    t.child_frame_id = "carrot1";
    t.transform.translation.x = 0.0;
    t.transform.translation.y = 2.0;
    t.transform.translation.z = 0.0;

1.2 CMakeLists.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Navigate one level back to the ``learning_tf2_cpp`` directory, where the ``CMakeLists.txt`` and ``package.xml`` files are located.

Now open the ``CMakeLists.txt`` add the executable and name it ``fixed_frame_tf2_broadcaster``.

.. code-block:: console

    add_executable(fixed_frame_tf2_broadcaster src/fixed_frame_tf2_broadcaster.cpp)
    ament_target_dependencies(
        fixed_frame_tf2_broadcaster
        geometry_msgs
        rclcpp
        tf2_ros
    )

Finally, add the ``install(TARGETSâ€¦)`` section so ``ros2 run`` can find your executable:

.. code-block:: console

    install(TARGETS
        fixed_frame_tf2_broadcaster
        DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME})

1.3 Write the launch file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now let's create a launch file for this example.
With your text editor, create a new file called ``turtle_tf2_fixed_frame_demo.launch.py``, and add the following lines:

.. code-block:: python

    import os

    from ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory

    from launch import LaunchDescription
    from launch.actions import IncludeLaunchDescription
    from launch.launch_description_sources import PythonLaunchDescriptionSource

    from launch_ros.actions import Node


    def generate_launch_description():
        demo_nodes = IncludeLaunchDescription(
            PythonLaunchDescriptionSource([os.path.join(
                get_package_share_directory('learning_tf2_cpp'), 'launch'),
                '/turtle_tf2_demo.launch.py']),
            )

        return LaunchDescription([
            demo_nodes,
            Node(
                package='learning_tf2_cpp',
                executable='fixed_frame_tf2_broadcaster',
                name='fixed_broadcaster',
            ),
        ])


This launch file imports the required packages and then creates a ``demo_nodes`` variable that will store nodes that we created in the previous tutorial's launch file.

The last part of the code will add our fixed ``carrot1`` frame to the turtlesim world using our ``fixed_frame_tf2_broadcaster`` node.

.. code-block:: python

    Node(
        package='learning_tf2_cpp',
        executable='fixed_frame_tf2_broadcaster',
        name='fixed_broadcaster',
    ),

1.4 Build
~~~~~~~~~

Run ``rosdep`` in the root of your workspace to check for missing dependencies.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      .. code-block:: console

          rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro {DISTRO} -y

   .. group-tab:: macOS

        rosdep only runs on Linux, so you will need to install ``geometry_msgs`` and ``turtlesim`` dependencies yourself

   .. group-tab:: Windows

        rosdep only runs on Linux, so you will need to install ``geometry_msgs`` and ``turtlesim`` dependencies yourself

From the root of your workspace, build your updated package:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      .. code-block:: console

          colcon build --packages-select learning_tf2_cpp

   .. group-tab:: macOS

      .. code-block:: console

          colcon build --packages-select learning_tf2_cpp

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      .. code-block:: console

          colcon build --merge-install --packages-select learning_tf2_cpp

Open a new terminal, navigate to the root of your workspace, and source the setup files:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      .. code-block:: console

          . install/setup.bash

   .. group-tab:: macOS

      .. code-block:: console

          . install/setup.bash

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      .. code-block:: console

          # CMD
          call install\setup.bat

          # Powershell
          .\install\setup.ps1

1.5 Run
~~~~~~~

Now you can start the turtle broadcaster demo:

.. code-block:: console

    ros2 launch learning_tf2_cpp turtle_tf2_fixed_frame_demo.launch.py

You should notice that the new ``carrot1`` frame appeared in the transformation tree.

.. image:: images/turtlesim_frames_carrot.png

If you drive the first turtle around, you should notice that the behavior didn't change from the previous tutorial, even though we added a new frame.
That's because adding an extra frame does not affect the other frames and our listener is still using the previously defined frames.

Therefore if we want our second turtle to follow the carrot instead of the first turtle, we need to change value of the ``target_frame``.
This can be done two ways.
One way is to pass the ``target_frame`` argument to the launch file directly from the console:

.. code-block:: console

    ros2 launch learning_tf2_cpp turtle_tf2_fixed_frame_demo.launch.py target_frame:=carrot1

The second way is to update the launch file.
To do so, open the ``turtle_tf2_fixed_frame_demo.launch.py`` file, and add the ``'target_frame': 'carrot1'`` parameter via ``launch_arguments`` argument.

.. code-block:: python

    def generate_launch_description():
        demo_nodes = IncludeLaunchDescription(
            ...,
            launch_arguments={'target_frame': 'carrot1'}.items(),
            )

Now rebuild the package, restart the ``turtle_tf2_fixed_frame_demo.launch.py``, and you'll see the second turtle following the carrot instead of the first turtle!

.. image:: images/carrot_static.png

2 Write the dynamic frame broadcaster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The extra frame we published in this tutorial is a fixed frame that doesn't change over time in relation to the parent frame.
However, if you want to publish a moving frame you can code the broadcaster to change the frame over time.
Let's change our ``carrot1`` frame so that it changes relative to ``turtle1`` frame over time.
Now download the dynamic frame broadcaster code by entering the following command:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      .. code-block:: console

          wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/geometry_tutorials/ros2/turtle_tf2_cpp/src/dynamic_frame_tf2_broadcaster.cpp

   .. group-tab:: macOS

      .. code-block:: console

          wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/geometry_tutorials/ros2/turtle_tf2_cpp/src/dynamic_frame_tf2_broadcaster.cpp

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      In a Windows command line prompt:

      .. code-block:: console

          curl -sk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/geometry_tutorials/ros2/turtle_tf2_cpp/src/dynamic_frame_tf2_broadcaster.cpp -o dynamic_frame_tf2_broadcaster.cpp

      Or in powershell:

      .. code-block:: console

          curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/geometry_tutorials/ros2/turtle_tf2_cpp/src/dynamic_frame_tf2_broadcaster.cpp -o dynamic_frame_tf2_broadcaster.cpp

Now open the file called ``dynamic_frame_tf2_broadcaster.cpp``:

.. code-block:: C++

    #include <chrono>
    #include <functional>
    #include <memory>

    #include "geometry_msgs/msg/transform_stamped.hpp"
    #include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"
    #include "tf2_ros/transform_broadcaster.h"

    using namespace std::chrono_literals;

    const double PI = 3.141592653589793238463;

    class DynamicFrameBroadcaster : public rclcpp::Node
    {
    public:
      DynamicFrameBroadcaster()
      : Node("dynamic_frame_tf2_broadcaster")
      {
        tf_broadcaster_ = std::make_shared<tf2_ros::TransformBroadcaster>(this);
        timer_ = this->create_wall_timer(
          100ms, std::bind(&DynamicFrameBroadcaster::broadcast_timer_callback, this));
      }

    private:
      void broadcast_timer_callback()
      {
        rclcpp::Time now = this->get_clock()->now();
        double x = now.seconds() * PI;

        geometry_msgs::msg::TransformStamped t;
        t.header.stamp = now;
        t.header.frame_id = "turtle1";
        t.child_frame_id = "carrot1";
        t.transform.translation.x = 10 * sin(x);
        t.transform.translation.y = 10 * cos(x);
        t.transform.translation.z = 0.0;
        t.transform.rotation.x = 0.0;
        t.transform.rotation.y = 0.0;
        t.transform.rotation.z = 0.0;
        t.transform.rotation.w = 1.0;

        tf_broadcaster_->sendTransform(t);
      }

      rclcpp::TimerBase::SharedPtr timer_;
      std::shared_ptr<tf2_ros::TransformBroadcaster> tf_broadcaster_;
    };

    int main(int argc, char * argv[])
    {
      rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
      rclcpp::spin(std::make_shared<DynamicFrameBroadcaster>());
      rclcpp::shutdown();
      return 0;
    }

2.1 Examine the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of a fixed definition of our x and y offsets, we are using the ``sin()`` and ``cos()`` functions on the current time so that the offset of ``carrot1`` is constantly changing.

.. code-block:: C++

    double x = now.seconds() * PI;
    ...
    t.transform.translation.x = 10 * sin(x);
    t.transform.translation.y = 10 * cos(x);

2.2 CMakeLists.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Navigate one level back to the ``learning_tf2_cpp`` directory, where the ``CMakeLists.txt`` and ``package.xml`` files are located.

Now open the ``CMakeLists.txt`` add the executable and name it ``dynamic_frame_tf2_broadcaster``.

.. code-block:: console

    add_executable(dynamic_frame_tf2_broadcaster src/dynamic_frame_tf2_broadcaster.cpp)
    ament_target_dependencies(
        dynamic_frame_tf2_broadcaster
        geometry_msgs
        rclcpp
        tf2_ros
    )

Finally, add the ``install(TARGETSâ€¦)`` section so ``ros2 run`` can find your executable:

.. code-block:: console

    install(TARGETS
        dynamic_frame_tf2_broadcaster
        DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME})

2.3 Write the launch file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test this code, create a new launch file ``turtle_tf2_dynamic_frame_demo.launch.py`` and paste the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    import os

    from ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory

    from launch import LaunchDescription
    from launch.actions import IncludeLaunchDescription
    from launch.launch_description_sources import PythonLaunchDescriptionSource

    from launch_ros.actions import Node


    def generate_launch_description():
        demo_nodes = IncludeLaunchDescription(
            PythonLaunchDescriptionSource([os.path.join(
                get_package_share_directory('learning_tf2_cpp'), 'launch'),
                '/turtle_tf2_demo.launch.py']),
            launch_arguments={'target_frame': 'carrot1'}.items(),
            )

        return LaunchDescription([
            demo_nodes,
            Node(
                package='learning_tf2_cpp',
                executable='dynamic_frame_tf2_broadcaster',
                name='dynamic_broadcaster',
            ),
        ])

2.4 Build
~~~~~~~~~

Run ``rosdep`` in the root of your workspace to check for missing dependencies.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      .. code-block:: console

          rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro {DISTRO} -y

   .. group-tab:: macOS

        rosdep only runs on Linux, so you will need to install ``geometry_msgs`` and ``turtlesim`` dependencies yourself

   .. group-tab:: Windows

        rosdep only runs on Linux, so you will need to install ``geometry_msgs`` and ``turtlesim`` dependencies yourself

From the root of your workspace, build your updated package:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      .. code-block:: console

          colcon build --packages-select learning_tf2_cpp

   .. group-tab:: macOS

      .. code-block:: console

          colcon build --packages-select learning_tf2_cpp

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      .. code-block:: console

          colcon build --merge-install --packages-select learning_tf2_cpp

Open a new terminal, navigate to the root of your workspace, and source the setup files:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      .. code-block:: console

          . install/setup.bash

   .. group-tab:: macOS

      .. code-block:: console

          . install/setup.bash

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      .. code-block:: console

          # CMD
          call install\setup.bat

          # Powershell
          .\install\setup.ps1

2.5 Run
~~~~~~~

Now you can start the dynamic frame demo:

.. code-block:: console

    ros2 launch learning_tf2_cpp turtle_tf2_dynamic_frame_demo.launch.py

You should see that the second turtle is following the carrot's position that is constantly changing.

Summary
-------

In this tutorial, you learned about the tf2 transformation tree, its structure, and its features.
You also learned that it is easiest to think inside a local frame, and learned to add extra fixed and dynamic frames for that local frame.
