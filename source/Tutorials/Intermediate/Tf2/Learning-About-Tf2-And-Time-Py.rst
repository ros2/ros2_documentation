Using time (Python)
===================

**Goal:** Learn to use the ``timeout`` in ``lookup_transform`` function to wait for a transform to be available on the tf2 tree.

Background
----------

In previous tutorials, we recreated the turtle demo by writing a :doc:`tf2 broadcaster <./Writing-A-Tf2-Broadcaster-Py>` and a :doc:`tf2 listener <./Writing-A-Tf2-Listener-Py>`.
We also learned how to :doc:`add a new frame to the transformation tree <./Adding-A-Frame-Py>`.
Now we will learn more about the ``timeout`` argument which makes the ``lookup_transform`` wait for the specified transform for up to the specified duration before throwing an exception.
This tool can be useful to listen for transforms that are published at varying rates or those incoming source with unreliable networking and non negligible latency.
This tutorial will teach you how use the timeout in ``lookup_transform`` function to wait for a transform to be available on the tf2 tree.

Tasks
-----

1 Update the listener node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Edit ``turtle_tf2_listener.py`` and remove the ``timeout=Duration(seconds=1.0)`` parameter that is passed to the ``lookup_transform()`` call on line 76.
It should look like shown below:

.. code-block:: python

   trans = self._tf_buffer.lookup_transform(
      to_frame_rel,
      from_frame_rel,
      now)

Moreover, import additional exceptions that we will handle in the beginning of the file:

.. code-block:: python

   from tf2_ros import LookupException, ConnectivityException, ExtrapolationException

Edit the exception handling on line 81 by adding newly imported exceptions and ``raise`` statement to see the exception:

.. code-block:: python

   except (LookupException, ConnectivityException, ExtrapolationException):
      self.get_logger().info('transform not ready')
      raise
      return

If you now try to run the launch file, you will notice that it is failing:

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 launch learning_tf2_py turtle_tf2_demo.launch.py

2 Fix the listener node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You now should notice that ``lookup_transform()`` is failing. It tells you that the frame does not exist or that the data is in the future.
To fix this, edit your code on line 76 as shown below (return the ``timeout`` parameter):

.. code-block:: python

   trans = self._tf_buffer.lookup_transform(
      to_frame_rel,
      from_frame_rel,
      now,
      timeout=rclpy.duration.Duration(seconds=1.0))

The ``lookup_transform`` can take four arguments, where the last one is an optional timeout.
It will block for up to that duration waiting for it to timeout.

.. note::

   Once this change is made, remove the ``raise`` line from the ``except()`` block that we added above or the code will continue to fail.

You can now run the launch file.

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 launch learning_tf2_py turtle_tf2_demo.launch.py

You should notice that ``lookup_transform()`` will actually block until the transform between the two turtles becomes available (this will usually take a few milli-seconds).
Once the timeout has been reached (one second in this case), an exception will be raised only if the transform is still not available.

Summary
-------

In this tutorial you learned more about the ``lookup_transform`` function and its timeout features.
You also learned how to catch and handle additional exceptions that can be thrown by tf2.
