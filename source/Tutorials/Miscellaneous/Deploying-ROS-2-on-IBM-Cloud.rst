About
-----

This article describes how to get ROS2 running on IBM Cloud using Docker files. It first gives a brief overview of docker images and how they work locally and then explores IBM Cloud and how the user can deploy their containers on it.
Afterwards, a short description of how the user can use their own custom packages for ROS2 from github on IBM Cloud is provided.
A walkthrough of how to create a cluster and utilize Kubernetes on IBM Cloud is provided and finally the Docker image is deployed on the cluster.

ROS2 on IBM Cloud
-----------------

In this tutorial, we show how you can easily integrate and run ROS2 on
IBM Cloud with your custom packages.

ROS2 is the new generation of ROS which gives more control over
multi-robot formations. With the advancements of cloud computing, cloud
robotics are becoming more important in today's age. In this tutorial,
we will go through a short introduction on running ROS2 on IBM Cloud. By
the end of the tutorial, you will be able to create your own packages in
ROS2 and deploy them to the cloud using docker files.

The following instructions assume you're using Linux and have been
tested with Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver).

Step 1: Setting up your system
-------------------------------

Before we go into how the exact process works, lets first make sure all
the required software is properly installed. We'll point you towards the
appropriate sources to set up your system and only highlight the details
that pertain to our use-case.

a) Docker files?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Docker files are a form of containers that can run separate from your
system, this way, you can set-up potentially hundreds of different
projects without affecting one another. You can even set-up different
versions of Linux on one machine, without the need for virtual machine.
Docker files have an advantage of saving space and only utilizing your
system resources when running. In addition, dockers are versatile and
transferable. They contain all the required pre-requisites to run
separately, meaning that you can easily use a docker file for a specific
system or service without any cubersome steps!

Excited yet? Let's start off by installing docker to your system by
following the following `link <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`__.
From the tutorial, you should have done some sanity checks to make sure
docker is properly set-up. Just in case, however, let's run the
following command once again that uses the hello-world docker image:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo docker run hello-world

You should obtain the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

   Hello from Docker!
   This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

   To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
    1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
    2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
       (amd64)
    3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
       executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
    4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
       to your terminal.

   To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
    $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

   Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
    https://hub.docker.com/

   For more examples and ideas, visit:
    https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

b) ROS2 Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ROS
`announced <https://discourse.ros.org/t/announcing-official-docker-images-for-ros2/7381/2>`__
image containers for several ROS distributions in January 2019. More
detailed instructions on the use of ROS2 docker images can be found
`here <https://hub.docker.com/_/ros/>`__.

Let's skip through that and get to real-deal right away; creating a
local ROS2 docker. We'll create our own Dockerfile (instead of using a
ready Image) since we'll need this method for deployment on IBM Cloud.
First, we create a new directory which will hold our Dockerfile and any
other files we need later on and navigate to it. Using your favorite
$EDITOR of choice, open a new file named *Dockerfile* (make sure the
file naming is correct):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mkdir ~/ros2_docker

   $ cd ~/ros2_docker

   $ $EDITOR Dockerfile

Insert the following in the *Dockerfile*, and save it (also found
`here <https://github.com/mm-nasr/ros2_ibmcloud/blob/main/dockers/ros2_basic/Dockerfile>`__):

.. code-block:: bash

   FROM ros:foxy

   # install ros package
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
         ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-demo-nodes-cpp \
         ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-demo-nodes-py && \
       rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* && mkdir /ros2_home

   WORKDIR /ros2_home

   # launch ros package
   CMD ["ros2", "launch", "demo_nodes_cpp", "talker_listener.launch.py"]

-  **FROM**: creates a layer from the ros:foxy Docker image
-  **RUN**: builds your container by installing vim into it and creating
   a directory called /ros2_home
-  **WORKDIR**: informs the container where the working directory should
   be for it

Of course, you are free to change the ROS distribution (*foxy* is used
here) or change the directory name. The above docker file sets up
ROS-foxy and installs the demo nodes for C++ and Python. Then it
launches a file which runs a talker and a listener node. We will see it
in action in just a few, but they act very similar to the
publisher-subscriber example found in the `ROS
wiki <https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28c%2B%2B%29>`__

Now, we are ready to build the docker image to run ROS2 in it (yes, it
is THAT easy!).

**Note**: if you have errors due to insufficient privileges or
*permission denied*, try running the command with *sudo* privileges:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ docker build .

   # You will see a bunch of lines that execute the docker file instructions followed by:
   Successfully built 0dc6ce7cb487

*0dc6ce7cb487* will most probably be different for you, so keep note of
it and copy it somewhere for reference. You can always go back and check
the docker images you have on your system using:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo docker ps -as

Now, run the docker file using:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ docker run -it 0dc6ce7cb487
   [INFO] [launch]: All log files can be found below /root/.ros/log/2020-10-28-02-41-45-177546-0b5d9ed123be-1
   [INFO] [launch]: Default logging verbosity is set to INFO
   [INFO] [talker-1]: process started with pid [28]
   [INFO] [listener-2]: process started with pid [30]
   [talker-1] [INFO] [1603852907.249886590] [talker]: Publishing: 'Hello World: 1'
   [listener-2] [INFO] [1603852907.250964490] [listener]: I heard: [Hello World: 1]
   [talker-1] [INFO] [1603852908.249786312] [talker]: Publishing: 'Hello World: 2'

   [listener-2] [INFO] [1603852909.250536089] [listener]: I heard: [Hello World: 3]
   [talker-1] [INFO] [1603852910.249845718] [talker]: Publishing: 'Hello World: 4'
   [listener-2] [INFO] [1603852910.250509355] [listener]: I heard: [Hello World: 4]
   [talker-1] [INFO] [1603852911.249506058] [talker]: Publishing: 'Hello World: 5'
   [listener-2] [INFO] [1603852911.250152324] [listener]: I heard: [Hello World: 5]
   [talker-1] [INFO] [1603852912.249556670] [talker]: Publishing: 'Hello World: 6'
   [listener-2] [INFO] [1603852912.250212678] [listener]: I heard: [Hello World: 6]

If it works correctly, you should see something similar to what is shown
above. As can be seen, there are two ROS nodes (a publisher and a
subscriber) running and their output is provided to us through ROS INFO.

Step 2: Running the image on IBM Cloud
--------------------------------------

The following steps assume you have an IBM cloud account and have
ibmcloud CLI installed. If not, please check this
`link <https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/reference/ibmcloud/download_cli.html>`__
out to get that done first.

We also need to make sure that the CLI plug-in for the IBM Cloud
Container Registry is installed by running the command

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ibmcloud plugin install container-registry

Afterwards, login to your ibmcloud account through the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ibmcloud login --sso

From here, let's create a container registry name-space. Make sure you
use a unique name that is also descriptive as to what it is. Here, I
used *ros2nasr*.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ibmcloud cr namespace-add ros2nasr

IBM cloud has a lot of shortcuts that would help us get our container
onto the cloud right away. The command below builds the container and
tags it with the name **ros2foxy** and the version of **1**. Make sure
you use the correct registry name you created and you are free to change
the container name as you wish. The **.** at the end indicates that the
*Dockerfile* is in the current directory (and it is important), if not,
change it to point to the directory containing the Dockerfile.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ibmcloud cr build --tag registry.bluemix.net/ros2nasr/ros2foxy:1 .

You can now make sure that the container has been pushed to the registry
you created by running the following command

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ibmcloud cr image-list
   Listing images...

   REPOSITORY               TAG   DIGEST         NAMESPACE   CREATED         SIZE     SECURITY STATUS
   us.icr.io/ros2nasr/ros2foxy   1     031be29301e6   ros2nasr    36 seconds ago   120 MB   No Issues

   OK

Next, it is important to log-in to your registry to run the docker
image. Again, if you face a *permission denied* error, perform the
command with sudo privileges. Afterwards, run your docker file as shown
below.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ibmcloud cr login
   Logging in to 'registry.ng.bluemix.net'...
   Logged in to 'registry.ng.bluemix.net'.
   Logging in to 'us.icr.io'...
   Logged in to 'us.icr.io'.

   OK

   $ docker run -v -it registry.ng.bluemix.net/ros2nasr/ros2foxy:1

Where *ros2nasr* is the name of the registry you created and
*ros2foxy:1* is the tag of the docker container and the version as
explained previously.

You should now see your docker file running and providing similar output
to that you saw when you ran it locally on your machine.

Step 3: Using Custom ROS2 Packages
------------------------------------

So now we have the full pipeline working, from creating the Dockerfile,
all the way to deploying it and seeing it work on IBM Cloud. But, what
if we want to use a custom set of packages we (or someone else) created?

Well that all has to do with how you set-up your Dockerfile. Lets use
the example provided by ROS2 `here <https://hub.docker.com/_/ros/>`__.
Create a new directory with a new Dockerfile (or overwrite the existing
one) and add the following in it (or download the file
`here <https://github.com/mm-nasr/ros2_ibmcloud/blob/main/dockers/git_pkgs_docker/Dockerfile>`__)

.. code-block:: bash

   ARG FROM_IMAGE=ros:foxy
   ARG OVERLAY_WS=/opt/ros/overlay_ws

   # multi-stage for caching
   FROM $FROM_IMAGE AS cacher

   # clone overlay source
   ARG OVERLAY_WS
   WORKDIR $OVERLAY_WS/src
   RUN echo "\
   repositories: \n\
     ros2/demos: \n\
       type: git \n\
       url: https://github.com/ros2/demos.git \n\
       version: ${ROS_DISTRO} \n\
   " > ../overlay.repos
   RUN vcs import ./ < ../overlay.repos

   # copy manifests for caching
   WORKDIR /opt
   RUN mkdir -p /tmp/opt && \
       find ./ -name "package.xml" | \
         xargs cp --parents -t /tmp/opt && \
       find ./ -name "COLCON_IGNORE" | \
         xargs cp --parents -t /tmp/opt || true

   # multi-stage for building
   FROM $FROM_IMAGE AS builder

   # install overlay dependencies
   ARG OVERLAY_WS
   WORKDIR $OVERLAY_WS
   COPY --from=cacher /tmp/$OVERLAY_WS/src ./src
   RUN . /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.sh && \
       apt-get update && rosdep install -y \
         --from-paths \
           src/ros2/demos/demo_nodes_cpp \
           src/ros2/demos/demo_nodes_py \
         --ignore-src \
       && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

   # build overlay source
   COPY --from=cacher $OVERLAY_WS/src ./src
   ARG OVERLAY_MIXINS="release"
   RUN . /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.sh && \
       colcon build \
         --packages-select \
           demo_nodes_cpp \
           demo_nodes_py \
         --mixin $OVERLAY_MIXINS

   # source entrypoint setup
   ENV OVERLAY_WS $OVERLAY_WS
   RUN sed --in-place --expression \
         '$isource "$OVERLAY_WS/install/setup.bash"' \
         /ros_entrypoint.sh

   # run launch file
   CMD ["ros2", "launch", "demo_nodes_cpp", "talker_listener.launch.py"]

Going through the lines shown, we can see how we can add custom packages
from github in 4 steps:

1. Create an overlay with custom packages cloned from Github:

.. code-block:: bash

   ARG OVERLAY_WS
   WORKDIR $OVERLAY_WS/src
   RUN echo "\
   repositories: \n\
     ros2/demos: \n\
       type: git \n\
       url: https://github.com/ros2/demos.git \n\
       version: ${ROS_DISTRO} \n\
   " > ../overlay.repos
   RUN vcs import ./ < ../overlay.repos

2. Install package dependencies using rosdep

.. code-block:: bash

   # install overlay dependencies
   ARG OVERLAY_WS
   WORKDIR $OVERLAY_WS
   COPY --from=cacher /tmp/$OVERLAY_WS/src ./src
   RUN . /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.sh && \
       apt-get update && rosdep install -y \
         --from-paths \
           src/ros2/demos/demo_nodes_cpp \
           src/ros2/demos/demo_nodes_py \
         --ignore-src \
       && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

3. Build the packages *you need*

.. code-block:: bash

   # build overlay source
   COPY --from=cacher $OVERLAY_WS/src ./src
   ARG OVERLAY_MIXINS="release"
   RUN . /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.sh && \
       colcon build \
         --packages-select \
           demo_nodes_cpp \
           demo_nodes_py \
         --mixin $OVERLAY_MIXINS

4. Running the launch file

.. code-block:: bash

   # run launch file
   CMD ["ros2", "launch", "demo_nodes_cpp", "talker_listener.launch.py"]

Likewise, we can change the packages used, install their dependencies,
and then run them.

**Back to IBM Cloud**

With this Dockerfile, we can follow the same steps we did before to
deploy it on IBM Cloud. Since we already have our registry created, and
we're logged in to IBM Cloud, we directly build our new Dockerfile.
Notice how I kept the tag the same but changed the version, this way I
can update the docker image created previously. (You are free to create
a completely new one if you want)

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ibmcloud cr build --tag registry.bluemix.net/ros2nasr/ros2foxy:2 .

Then, make sure you are logged in to the registry and run the new docker
image:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ibmcloud cr login
   Logging in to 'registry.ng.bluemix.net'...
   Logged in to 'registry.ng.bluemix.net'.
   Logging in to 'us.icr.io'...
   Logged in to 'us.icr.io'.

   OK

   $ docker run -v -it registry.ng.bluemix.net/ros2nasr/ros2foxy:2

You should see, again, the same output. However, this time we did it
through custom packages from github, which allows us to utilize our
personally created packages for ROS2 on IBM Cloud.

Extra: Deleting Docker Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As you may find yourself in need of deleting a specific docker image(s)
from IBM Cloud, this is how you should go about it!

1. List all the images you have and find all the ones that share the
   *IMAGE* name corresponding to
   *registry.ng.bluemix.net/ros2nasr/ros2foxy:2* (in my case). Then
   delete them using their *NAMES*

.. code-block:: bash

   $ docker rm your_docker_NAMES

2. Delete the docker image from IBM Cloud using its *IMAGE* name

.. code-block:: bash

   $ docker rmi registry.ng.bluemix.net/ros2nasr/ros2foxy:2

Step 4: Kubernetes
-------------------

a) Creating the Cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a cluster using the Console. The instructions are found
`here <https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters#clusters_ui>`__.
The settings used are detailed below. These are merely suggestions and
can be changed if you need to. However, make sure you understand the
implications of your choices:

1. Plan: *Standard*

2. Orchestration Service: *Kubernetes v1.18.10*

3. Infrastructure: *Classic*

4. Location:

-  Resource group: *Default*

-  Geography: *North America* (you are free to change this)

-  Availability: *Single zone* (you are free to change this but make
   sure you understand the impact of your choices by checking the IBM
   Cloud documentation.)

-  Worker Zone: *Toronto 01* (choose the location that is physically
   closest to you)

5. Worker Pool:

-  Virtual - shared, Ubuntu 18

-  Memory: 16 GB

-  Worker nodes per zone: *1*

6. Master service endpoint: *Both private & public endpoints*

7. Resource details (Totally flexible):

-  Cluster name: *mycluster-tor01-rosibm*

-  Tags: *version:1*

After you create your cluster, you will be redirected to a page which
details how you can set up the CLI tools and access your cluster. Please
follow these instructions (or check the instructions
`here <https://github.com/mm-nasr/ros2_ibmcloud/blob/main/Kubernetes-Cluster-Set-up.md>`__)and
wait for the progress bar to show that the worker nodes you created are
ready by indicating *Normal* next to the cluster name. You can also
reach this screen from the IBM Cloud Console inside the Kubernetes.

b) Deploying your Docker Image *Finally!*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Create a deployment configuration yaml file named
   *ros2-deployment.yaml* using your favorite $EDITOR and insert the
   following in it:

.. code-block:: bash

   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: <deployment>
   spec:
     replicas: <number_of_replicas>
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: <app_name>
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: <app_name>
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: <app_name>
           image: <region>.icr.io/<namespace>/<image>:<tag>

You should replace the tags shown between *"<" ">"* as described
`here <https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-images#namespace>`__.
The file in my case would look something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: ros2-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: ros2-ibmcloud
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: ros2-ibmcloud
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: ros2-ibmcloud
           image: us.icr.io/ros2nasr/ros2foxy:2

Deploy the file using the following command

.. code-block:: bash

   $ kubectl apply -f ros2-deployment.yaml
   deployment.apps/ros2-deployment created

Now your docker image is fully deployed on your cluster!

Step 5: Using CLI for your Docker Image
---------------------------------------

1. Navigate to your cluster through the IBM Cloud console Kubernetes.

2. Click on *Kubernetes dashboard* on the top right corner of the page.

You should now be able to see a full list of all the different
parameters of your cluster as well as its CPU and Memory Usage.

3. Navigate to *Pods* and click on your deployment.

4. On the top right corner, click on *Exec into pod*

Now you are inside your docker image! You can source your workspace (if
needed) and run ROS2! For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   root@ros2-deployment-xxxxxxxx:/opt/ros/overlay_ws# . install/setup.sh
   root@ros2-deployment-xxxxxxxx:/opt/ros/overlay_ws# ros2 launch demo_nodes_cpp talker_listener.launch.py

Final Remarks
---------------

At this point, you are capable of creating your own docker image using ROS2 packages on github. It is also possible, with little changes to utilize local ROS2 packages as well. This could be the topic of another article. However, you are encouraged to check out the following `Dockerfile <https://github.com/mm-nasr/ros2_ibmcloud/tree/main/dockers/local_pkgs_docker>`__ which uses a local copy of the demos repository. Similarly, you can use your own local package.
