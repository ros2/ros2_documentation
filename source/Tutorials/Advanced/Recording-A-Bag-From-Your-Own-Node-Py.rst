Recording a bag from a node (Python)
====================================

**Goal:** Record data from your own Python node to a bag.

**Tutorial level:** Advanced

**Time:** 20 minutes

Background
----------

``rosbag2`` doesn't just provide the ``ros2 bag`` command line tool.
It also provides a Python API for reading from and writing to a bag from your own source code.
This allows you to subscribe to a topic and save the received data to a bag at the same time as performing any other processing of your choice on that data.
You may do this, for example, to save data from a topic and the result of processing that data without needing to send the processed data over a topic just to record it.
Because any data can be recorded in a bag, it is also possible to save data generated by another source than a topic, such as synthetic data for training sets.
This is useful, for example, for quickly generating a bag that contains a large number of samples spread over a long playback time.

Prerequisites
-------------

You should have the ``rosbag2`` packages installed as part of your regular ROS 2 setup.

If you've installed from Debian packages on Linux, it may be installed by default.
If it is not, you can install it using this command.

.. code-block:: console

  sudo apt install ros-{DISTRO}-rosbag2

This tutorial discusses using ROS 2 bags, including from the terminal.
You should have already completed the :doc:`basic ROS 2 bag tutorial <../Beginner-CLI-Tools/Recording-And-Playing-Back-Data/Recording-And-Playing-Back-Data>`.

Tasks
-----

1 Create a package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a new terminal and :doc:`source your ROS 2 installation <../Beginner-CLI-Tools/Configuring-ROS2-Environment>` so that ``ros2`` commands will work.

Follow :ref:`these instructions <new-directory>` to create a new workspace named ``ros2_ws``.

Navigate into the ``ros2_ws/src`` directory and create a new package:

.. code-block:: console

  ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python bag_recorder_nodes_py --dependencies rclpy rosbag2_py example_interfaces std_msgs

Your terminal will return a message verifying the creation of your package ``bag_recorder_nodes_py`` and all its necessary files and folders.
The ``--dependencies`` argument will automatically add the necessary dependency lines to the ``package.xml``.
In this case, the package will use the ``rosbag2_py`` package as well as the ``rclpy`` package.
A dependency on the ``example_interfaces`` package is also required for message definitions.

1.1 Update ``package.xml`` and ``setup.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because you used the ``--dependencies`` option during package creation, you don't have to manually add dependencies to ``package.xml``.
As always, though, make sure to add the description, maintainer email and name, and license information to ``package.xml``.

.. code-block:: xml

  <description>Python bag writing tutorial</description>
  <maintainer email="you@email.com">Your Name</maintainer>
  <license>Apache License 2.0</license>

Also be sure to add this information to the ``setup.py`` file as well.

.. code-block:: Python

   maintainer='Your Name',
   maintainer_email='you@email.com',
   description='Python bag writing tutorial',
   license='Apache License 2.0',

2 Write the Python node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inside the ``ros2_ws/src/bag_recorder_nodes_py/bag_recorder_nodes_py`` directory, create a new file called ``simple_bag_recorder.py`` and paste the following code into it.

.. code-block:: Python

   import rclpy
   from rclpy.node import Node
   from rclpy.serialization import serialize_message
   from std_msgs.msg import String

   import rosbag2_py

   class SimpleBagRecorder(Node):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__('simple_bag_recorder')
           self.writer = rosbag2_py.SequentialWriter()

           storage_options = rosbag2_py._storage.StorageOptions(
               uri='my_bag',
               storage_id='sqlite3')
           converter_options = rosbag2_py._storage.ConverterOptions('', '')
           self.writer.open(storage_options, converter_options)

           topic_info = rosbag2_py._storage.TopicMetadata(
               name='chatter',
               type='std_msgs/msg/String',
               serialization_format='cdr')
           self.writer.create_topic(topic_info)

           self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
               String,
               'chatter',
               self.topic_callback,
               10)
           self.subscription

       def topic_callback(self, msg):
           self.writer.write(
               'chatter',
               serialize_message(msg),
               self.get_clock().now().nanoseconds)


   def main(args=None):
       rclpy.init(args=args)
       sbr = SimpleBagRecorder()
       rclpy.spin(sbr)
       rclpy.shutdown()


   if __name__ == '__main__':
       main()

2.1 Examine the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``import`` statements at the top are the package dependencies.
Note the importation of the ``rosbag2_py`` package for the functions and structures necessary to work with bag files.

In the class constructor, we begin by creating the writer object that we will use to write to the bag.
We are creating a ``SequentialWriter``, which writes messages into the bag in the order they are received.
Other writers with different behaviours may be available in `rosbag2 <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/tree/{REPOS_FILE_BRANCH}/rosbag2_cpp/include/rosbag2_cpp/writers>`__.

.. code-block:: Python

   self.writer = rosbag2_py.SequentialWriter()

Now that we have a writer object, we can open the bag using it.
We specify the URI of the bag to create and the format (``sqlite3``), leaving other options at their defaults.
The default conversion options are used, which will perform no conversion and store the messages in the serialization format they are received in.

.. code-block:: Python

   storage_options = rosbag2_py._storage.StorageOptions(
       uri='my_bag',
       storage_id='sqlite3')
   converter_options = rosbag2_py._storage.ConverterOptions('', '')
   self.writer.open(storage_options, converter_options)

Next, we need to tell the writer about the topics we wish to store.
This is done by creating a ``TopicMetadata`` object and registering it with the writer.
This object specifies the topic name, topic data type, and serialization format used.

.. code-block:: Python

   topic_info = rosbag2_py._storage.TopicMetadata(
       name='chatter',
       type='std_msgs/msg/String',
       serialization_format='cdr')
   self.writer.create_topic(topic_info)

With the writer now set up to record data we pass to it, we create a subscription and specify a callback for it.
We will write data to the bag in the callback.

.. code-block:: Python

   self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
       String,
       'chatter',
       self.topic_callback,
       10)
   self.subscription

The callback receives the message in unserialized form (as is standard for the ``rclpy`` API) and passes the message to the writer, specifying the topic that the data is for and the timestamp to record with the message.
However, the writer requires serialised messages to store in the bag.
This means that we need to serialise the data before passing it to the writer.
For this reason, we call ``serialize_message()`` and pass the result of that to the writer, rather than passing in the message directly.

.. code-block:: Python

   def topic_callback(self, msg):
       self.writer.write(
           'chatter',
           serialize_message(msg),
           self.get_clock().now().nanoseconds)

The file finishes with the ``main`` function used to create an instance of the node and start ROS processing it.

.. code-block:: Python

   def main(args=None):
       rclpy.init(args=args)
       sbr = SimpleBagRecorder()
       rclpy.spin(sbr)
       rclpy.shutdown()

2.2 Add entry point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the ``setup.py`` file in the ``bag_recorder_nodes_py`` package and add an entry point for your node.

.. code-block:: Python

   entry_points={
       'console_scripts': [
           'simple_bag_recorder = bag_recorder_nodes_py.simple_bag_recorder:main',
       ],
   },


3 Build and run
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Navigate back to the root of your workspace, ``ros2_ws``, and build your new package.

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      colcon build --packages-select bag_recorder_nodes_py

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      colcon build --packages-select bag_recorder_nodes_py

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

      colcon build --merge-install --packages-select bag_recorder_nodes_py

Open a new terminal, navigate to ``ros2_ws``, and source the setup files.

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      source install/setup.bash

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      source install/setup.bash

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

      call install/setup.bat

Now run the node:

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 run bag_recorder_nodes_py simple_bag_recorder

Open a second terminal and run the ``talker`` example node.

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

This will start publishing data on the ``chatter`` topic.
As the bag-writing node receives this data, it will write it to the ``my_bag`` bag.
If the ``my_bag`` directory already exists, you must first delete it before running the ``simple_bag_recorder`` node.
This is because ``rosbag2`` will not overwrite existing bags by default, and so the destination directory cannot exist.

Terminate both nodes.
Then, in one terminal start the ``listener`` example node.

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener

In the other terminal, use ``ros2 bag`` to play the bag recorded by your node.

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 bag play my_bag

You will see the messages from the bag being received by the ``listener`` node.

If you wish to run the bag-writing node again, you will first need to delete the ``my_bag`` directory.

4 Record synthetic data from a node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any data can be recorded into a bag, not just data received over a topic.
A common use case for writing to a bag from your own node is to generate and store synthetic data.
In this section you will learn how to write a node that generates some data and stores it in a bag.
We will demonstrate two approaches for doing this.
The first uses a node with a timer; this is the approach that you would use if your data generation is external to the node, such as reading data directly from hardware (e.g. a camera).
The second approach does not use a node; this is the approach you can use when you do not need to use any functionality from the ROS infrastructure.

4.1 Write a Python node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inside the ``ros2_ws/src/bag_recorder_nodes_py/bag_recorder_nodes_py`` directory, create a new file called ``data_generator_node.py`` and paste the following code into it.

.. code-block:: Python

   import rclpy
   from rclpy.node import Node
   from rclpy.serialization import serialize_message
   from example_interfaces.msg import Int32

   import rosbag2_py

   class DataGeneratorNode(Node):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__('data_generator_node')
           self.data = Int32()
           self.data.data = 0
           self.writer = rosbag2_py.SequentialWriter()

           storage_options = rosbag2_py._storage.StorageOptions(
               uri='timed_synthetic_bag',
               storage_id='sqlite3')
           converter_options = rosbag2_py._storage.ConverterOptions('', '')
           self.writer.open(storage_options, converter_options)

           topic_info = rosbag2_py._storage.TopicMetadata(
               name='synthetic',
               type='example_interfaces/msg/Int32',
               serialization_format='cdr')
           self.writer.create_topic(topic_info)

           self.timer = self.create_timer(1, self.timer_callback)

       def timer_callback(self):
           self.writer.write(
               'synthetic',
               serialize_message(self.data),
               self.get_clock().now().nanoseconds)
           self.data.data += 1


   def main(args=None):
       rclpy.init(args=args)
       dgn = DataGeneratorNode()
       rclpy.spin(dgn)
       rclpy.shutdown()


   if __name__ == '__main__':
       main()

4.2 Examine the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Much of this code is the same as the first example.
The important differences are described here.

First, the name of the bag is changed.

.. code-block:: Python

   storage_options = rosbag2_py._storage.StorageOptions(
       uri='timed_synthetic_bag',
       storage_id='sqlite3')

The name of the topic is also changed, as is the data type stored.

.. code-block:: Python

   topic_info = rosbag2_py._storage.TopicMetadata(
       name='synthetic',
       type='example_interfaces/msg/Int32',
       serialization_format='cdr')
   self.writer.create_topic(topic_info)

Rather than a subscription to a topic, this node has a timer.
The timer fires with a one-second period, and calls the given member function when it does.

.. code-block:: Python

   self.timer = self.create_timer(1, self.timer_callback)

Within the timer callback, we generate (or otherwise obtain, e.g. read from a serial port connected to some hardware) the data we wish to store in the bag.
As with the previous example, the data is not yet serialised, so we must serialise it before passing it to the writer.

.. code-block:: Python

   self.writer.write(
       'synthetic',
       serialize_message(self.data),
       self.get_clock().now().nanoseconds)

4.3 Add executable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the ``setup.py`` file in the ``bag_recorder_nodes_py`` package and add an entry point for your node.

.. code-block:: Python

   entry_points={
       'console_scripts': [
           'simple_bag_recorder = bag_recorder_nodes_py.simple_bag_recorder:main',
           'data_generator_node = bag_recorder_nodes_py.data_generator_node:main',
       ],
   },

4.4 Build and run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Navigate back to the root of your workspace, ``ros2_ws``, and build your package.

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      colcon build --packages-select bag_recorder_nodes_py

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      colcon build --packages-select bag_recorder_nodes_py

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

      colcon build --merge-install --packages-select bag_recorder_nodes_py

Open a new terminal, navigate to ``ros2_ws``, and source the setup files.

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      source install/setup.bash

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      source install/setup.bash

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

      call install/setup.bat

If the ``timed_synthetic_bag`` directory already exists, you must first delete it before running the node.

Now run the node:

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 run bag_recorder_nodes_py data_generator_node

Wait for 30 seconds or so, then terminate the node with :kbd:`ctrl-c`.
Next, play back the created bag.

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 bag play timed_synthetic_bag

Open a second terminal and echo the ``/synthetic`` topic.

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 topic echo /synthetic

You will see the data that was generated and stored in the bag printed to the console at a rate of one message per second.

5 Record synthetic data from an executable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that you can create a bag that stores data from a source other than a topic, you will learn how to generate and record synthetic data from a non-node executable.
The advantage of this approach is simpler code and rapid creation of a large quantity of data.

5.1 Write a Python executable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inside the ``ros2_ws/src/bag_recorder_nodes_py/bag_recorder_nodes_py`` directory, create a new file called ``data_generator_executable.py`` and paste the following code into it.

.. code-block:: Python

   from rclpy.clock import Clock
   from rclpy.duration import Duration
   from rclpy.serialization import serialize_message
   from example_interfaces.msg import Int32

   import rosbag2_py


   def main(args=None):
       writer = rosbag2_py.SequentialWriter()

       storage_options = rosbag2_py._storage.StorageOptions(
           uri='big_synthetic_bag',
           storage_id='sqlite3')
       converter_options = rosbag2_py._storage.ConverterOptions('', '')
       writer.open(storage_options, converter_options)

       topic_info = rosbag2_py._storage.TopicMetadata(
           name='synthetic',
           type='example_interfaces/msg/Int32',
           serialization_format='cdr')
       writer.create_topic(topic_info)

       time_stamp = Clock().now()
       for ii in range(0, 100):
           data = Int32()
           data.data = ii
           writer.write(
               'synthetic',
               serialize_message(data),
               time_stamp.nanoseconds)
           time_stamp += Duration(seconds=1)

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       main()

5.2 Examine the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A comparison of this sample and the previous sample will reveal that they are not that different.
The only significant difference is the use of a for loop to drive the data generation rather than a timer.

Notice that we are also now generating time stamps for the data rather than relying on the current system time for each sample.
The time stamp can be any value you need it to be.
The data will be played back at the rate given by these time stamps, so this is a useful way to control the default playback speed of the samples.
Notice also that while the gap between each sample is a full second in time, this executable does not need to wait a second between each sample.
This allows us to generate a lot of data covering a wide span of time in much less time than playback will take.

.. code-block:: Python

   time_stamp = Clock().now()
   for ii in range(0, 100):
       data = Int32()
       data.data = ii
       writer.write(
           'synthetic',
           serialize_message(data),
           time_stamp.nanoseconds)
       time_stamp += Duration(seconds=1)

5.3 Add executable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the ``setup.py`` file in the ``bag_recorder_nodes_py`` package and add an entry point for your node.

.. code-block:: Python

   entry_points={
       'console_scripts': [
           'simple_bag_recorder = bag_recorder_nodes_py.simple_bag_recorder:main',
           'data_generator_node = bag_recorder_nodes_py.data_generator_node:main',
           'data_generator_executable = bag_recorder_nodes_py.data_generator_executable:main',
       ],
   },

5.4 Build and run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Navigate back to the root of your workspace, ``ros2_ws``, and build your package.

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      colcon build --packages-select bag_recorder_nodes_py

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      colcon build --packages-select bag_recorder_nodes_py

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

      colcon build --merge-install --packages-select bag_recorder_nodes_py

Open a terminal, navigate to ``ros2_ws``, and source the setup files.

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      source install/setup.bash

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      source install/setup.bash

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

      call install/setup.bat

If the ``big_synthetic_bag`` directory already exists, you must first delete it before running the executable.

Now run the executable:

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 run bag_recorder_nodes_py data_generator_executable

Note that the executable runs and finishes very quickly.

Now play back the created bag.

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 bag play big_synthetic_bag

Open a second terminal and echo the ``/synthetic`` topic.

.. code-block:: console

   ros2 topic echo /synthetic

You will see the data that was generated and stored in the bag printed to the console at a rate of one message per second.
Even though the bag was generated rapidly it is still played back at the rate the time stamps indicate.

Summary
-------

You created a node that records data it receives on a topic into a bag.
You tested recording a bag using the node, and verified the data was recorded by playing back the bag.
This approach can be used to record a bag with additional data than it received over a topic, for example with results obtained from processing the received data.
You then went on to create a node and an executable to generate synthetic data and store it in a bag.
The latter approaches are useful especially for generating synthetic data that can be used, for example, as training sets.
