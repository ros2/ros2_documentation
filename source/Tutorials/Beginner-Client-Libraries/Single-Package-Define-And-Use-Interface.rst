Background
----------

In a :doc:`previous tutorial <./Custom-ROS2-Interfaces>`, you learned how to create custom msg and srv interfaces.

While best practice is to declare interfaces in dedicated interface packages, sometimes it can be convenient to declare, create and use an interface all in one package.

Recall that interfaces can currently only be defined in CMake packages.
It is possible, however, to have Python libraries and nodes in CMake packages (using `ament_cmake_python <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/tree/{REPOS_FILE_BRANCH}/ament_cmake_python>`_), so you could define interfaces and Python nodes together in one package.
We'll use a CMake package and C++ nodes here for the sake of simplicity.

This tutorial will focus on the msg interface type, but the steps here are applicable to all interface types.

Prerequisites
-------------

We assume you've reviewed the basics in the :doc:`./Custom-ROS2-Interfaces` tutorial before working through this one.

You should have :doc:`ROS 2 installed <../../Installation>`, a :doc:`workspace <./Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace>`, and an understanding of :doc:`creating packages <./Creating-Your-First-ROS2-Package>`.

As always, donâ€™t forget to :doc:`source ROS 2 <../Beginner-CLI-Tools/Configuring-ROS2-Environment>` in every new terminal you open.

Tasks
-----

1 Create a package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In your workspace ``src`` directory, create a package ``more_interfaces`` and make a folder within it for msg files:

.. code-block:: console

  ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake more_interfaces
  mkdir more_interfaces/msg

2 Create a msg file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inside ``more_interfaces/msg``, create a new file ``AddressBook.msg``

Paste the following code to create a message meant to carry information about an individual:

::

   bool FEMALE=true
   bool MALE=false

   string first_name
   string last_name
   bool gender
   uint8 age
   string address

This message is composed of 5 fields:

* first_name: of type string
* last_name: of type string
* gender: of type bool, that can be either MALE or FEMALE
* age: of type uint8
* address: of type string

Notice that it's possible to set default values for fields within the message definition.
See :doc:`../../Concepts/About-ROS-Interfaces` for more ways you can customize interfaces.

Next, we need to make sure that the msg file is turned into source code for C++, Python, and other languages.

2.1 Build a msg file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open ``package.xml``, and add the following lines:

.. code-block:: xml

     <buildtool_depend>rosidl_default_generators</buildtool_depend>

     <exec_depend>rosidl_default_runtime</exec_depend>

     <member_of_group>rosidl_interface_packages</member_of_group>

Note that at build time, we need ``rosidl_default_generators``, while at runtime, we only need ``rosidl_default_runtime``.

Open ``CMakeLists.txt`` and add the following lines:

Find the package that generates message code from msg/srv files:

.. code-block:: cmake

   find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)

Declare the list of messages you want to generate:

.. code-block:: cmake

   set(msg_files
     "msg/AddressBook.msg"
   )

By adding the .msg files manually, we make sure that CMake knows when it has to reconfigure the project after you add other .msg files.

Generate the messages:

.. code-block:: cmake

   rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
     ${msg_files}
   )

Also make sure you export the message runtime dependency:

.. code-block:: cmake

   ament_export_dependencies(rosidl_default_runtime)

Now you're ready to generate source files from your msg definition.
We'll skip the compile step for now as we do it all together below in step 4.

2.2 (Extra) Set multiple interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

  You can use ``set`` to neatly list all of your interfaces:

  .. code-block:: cmake

     set(msg_files
       "msg/Message1.msg"
       "msg/Message2.msg"
       # etc
       )

     set(srv_files
       "srv/Service1.srv"
       "srv/Service2.srv"
        # etc
       )

  And generate all lists at once like so:

  .. code-block:: cmake

     rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
       ${msg_files}
       ${srv_files}
     )


3 Use an interface from the same package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we can start writing code that uses this message.

In ``more_interfaces/src`` create a file called ``publish_address_book.cpp`` and paste the following code:

.. code-block:: c++

  #include <chrono>
  #include <memory>

  #include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"
  #include "more_interfaces/msg/address_book.hpp"

  using namespace std::chrono_literals;

  class AddressBookPublisher : public rclcpp::Node
  {
  public:
    AddressBookPublisher()
    : Node("address_book_publisher")
    {
      address_book_publisher_ =
        this->create_publisher<more_interfaces::msg::AddressBook>("address_book", 10);

      auto publish_msg = [this]() -> void {
          auto message = more_interfaces::msg::AddressBook();

          message.first_name = "John";
          message.last_name = "Doe";
          message.age = 30;
          message.gender = message.MALE;
          message.address = "unknown";

          std::cout << "Publishing Contact\nFirst:" << message.first_name <<
            "  Last:" << message.last_name << std::endl;

          this->address_book_publisher_->publish(message);
        };
      timer_ = this->create_wall_timer(1s, publish_msg);
    }

  private:
    rclcpp::Publisher<more_interfaces::msg::AddressBook>::SharedPtr address_book_publisher_;
    rclcpp::TimerBase::SharedPtr timer_;
  };


  int main(int argc, char * argv[])
  {
    rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
    rclcpp::spin(std::make_shared<AddressBookPublisher>());
    rclcpp::shutdown();

    return 0;
  }

3.1 The code explained
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: c++

   #include "more_interfaces/msg/address_book.hpp"

Include the header of our newly created ``AddressBook.msg``.

.. code-block:: c++

   using namespace std::chrono_literals;

   class AddressBookPublisher : public rclcpp::Node
   {
   public:
     AddressBookPublisher()
     : Node("address_book_publisher")
     {
       address_book_publisher_ =
         this->create_publisher<more_interfaces::msg::AddressBook>("address_book");

Create a node and an ``AddressBook`` publisher.

.. code-block:: c++

    auto publish_msg = [this]() -> void {

Create a callback to publish the messages periodically.

.. code-block:: c++

    auto message = more_interfaces::msg::AddressBook();

Create an ``AddressBook`` message instance that we will later publish.

.. code-block:: c++

    message.first_name = "John";
    message.last_name = "Doe";
    message.age = 30;
    message.gender = message.MALE;
    message.address = "unknown";

Populate ``AddressBook`` fields.

.. code-block:: c++

    std::cout << "Publishing Contact\nFirst:" << message.first_name <<
      "  Last:" << message.last_name << std::endl;

    this->address_book_publisher_->publish(message);

Finally send the message periodically.

.. code-block:: c++

       timer_ = this->create_wall_timer(1s, publish_msg);

Create a 1 second timer to call our ``publish_msg`` function every second.

3.2 Build the publisher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We need to create a new target for this node in the ``CMakeLists.txt``:

.. code-block:: cmake

   find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)

   add_executable(publish_address_book
     src/publish_address_book.cpp
   )

   ament_target_dependencies(publish_address_book
     "rclcpp"
   )

   install(TARGETS publish_address_book
    DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME})

3.3 Link against the interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use the messages generated in the same package we need to use the following CMake code:

.. code-block:: cmake

  rosidl_get_typesupport_target(cpp_typesupport_target
    ${PROJECT_NAME} "rosidl_typesupport_cpp")

  target_link_libraries(publish_address_book "${cpp_typesupport_target}")

This finds the relevant generated C++ code from ``AddressBook.msg`` and allows your target to link against it.

You may have noticed that this step was not necessary when the interfaces being used were from a package that was built separately.
This CMake code is only required when you want to use interfaces in the same package as the one in which they are used.

4 Try it out
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Return to the root of the workspace to build the package:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      cd ~/ros2_ws
      colcon build --packages-up-to more_interfaces

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      cd ~/ros2_ws
      colcon build --packages-up-to more_interfaces

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

      cd /ros2_ws
      colcon build --merge-install --packages-up-to more_interfaces

Then source the workspace and run the publisher:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      . install/local_setup.bash
      ros2 run more_interfaces publish_address_book

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      . install/local_setup.bash
      ros2 run more_interfaces publish_address_book

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

      call install/local_setup.bat
      ros2 run more_interfaces publish_address_book

    Or using Powershell:

    .. code-block:: console

      install/local_setup.ps1
      ros2 run more_interfaces publish_address_book

You should see the publisher relaying the msg you defined, including the values you set in ``publish_address_book.cpp``.

To confirm the message is being published on the ``address_book`` topic, open another terminal, source the workspace, and call ``topic echo``:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      . install/setup.bash
      ros2 topic echo /address_book

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      . install/setup.bash
      ros2 topic echo /address_book

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

      call install/setup.bat
      ros2 topic echo /address_book

    Or using Powershell:

    .. code-block:: console

      install/setup.ps1
      ros2 topic echo /address_book

We won't create a subscriber in this tutorial, but you can try to write one yourself for practice (use :doc:`./Writing-A-Simple-Cpp-Publisher-And-Subscriber` to help).

5 (Extra) Use an existing interface definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

  You can use an existing interface definition in a new interface definition.
  For example, let's say there is a message named ``Contact.msg`` that belongs to an existing ROS 2 package named ``rosidl_tutorials_msgs``.
  Assume that its definition is identical to our custom-made ``AddressBook.msg`` interface from earlier.

  In that case you could have defined ``AddressBook.msg`` (an interface in the package *with* your nodes) as type ``Contact`` (an interface in a *separate* package).
  You could even define ``AddressBook.msg`` as an *array* of type ``Contact``, like so:

  ::

     rosidl_tutorials_msgs/Contact[] address_book

  To generate this message you would need to declare a dependency on ``Contact.msg's`` package, ``rosidl_tutorials_msgs``, in ``package.xml``:

  .. code-block:: xml

       <build_depend>rosidl_tutorials_msgs</build_depend>

       <exec_depend>rosidl_tutorials_msgs</exec_depend>

  And in ``CMakeLists.txt``:

  .. code-block:: cmake

     find_package(rosidl_tutorials_msgs REQUIRED)

     rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
       ${msg_files}
       DEPENDENCIES rosidl_tutorials_msgs
     )

  You would also need to include the header of ``Contact.msg`` in you publisher node in order to be able to add ``contacts`` to your ``address_book``.

  .. code-block:: c++

     #include "rosidl_tutorials_msgs/msg/contact.hpp"

  You could change the call back to something like this:

  .. code-block:: c++

    auto publish_msg = [this]() -> void {
       auto msg = std::make_shared<more_interfaces::msg::AddressBook>();
       {
         rosidl_tutorials_msgs::msg::Contact contact;
         contact.first_name = "John";
         contact.last_name = "Doe";
         contact.age = 30;
         contact.gender = contact.MALE;
         contact.address = "unknown";
         msg->address_book.push_back(contact);
       }
       {
         rosidl_tutorials_msgs::msg::Contact contact;
         contact.first_name = "Jane";
         contact.last_name = "Doe";
         contact.age = 20;
         contact.gender = contact.FEMALE;
         contact.address = "unknown";
         msg->address_book.push_back(contact);
       }

       std::cout << "Publishing address book:" << std::endl;
       for (auto contact : msg->address_book) {
         std::cout << "First:" << contact.first_name << "  Last:" << contact.last_name <<
           std::endl;
       }

       address_book_publisher_->publish(*msg);
     };

  Building and running these changes would show the msg defined as expected, as well as the array of msgs defined above.

Summary
-------

In this tutorial, you tried out different field types for defining interfaces, then built an interface in the same package where it's being used.

You also learned how to use another interface as a field type, as well as the ``package.xml``, ``CMakeLists.txt``, and ``#include`` statements necessary for utilizing that feature.

Next steps
----------

Next you will create a simple ROS 2 package with a custom parameter that you will learn to set from a launch file.
Again, you can choose to write it in either :doc:`C++ <./Using-Parameters-In-A-Class-CPP>` or :doc:`Python <./Using-Parameters-In-A-Class-Python>`.
